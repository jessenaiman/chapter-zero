# Stage 1 Test Cases

## Visual State Transitions

### Boot Sequence (State 1)
1. Verify heavy glitch interference shows historical interfaces beneath
2. Confirm scanlines move erratically at 3x normal speed
3. Check color channels split by 5-8 pixels
4. Validate ancient symbols bleed through at 80% opacity
5. Ensure text corruption replaces some characters with cuneiform/hieroglyphs

### Stable Baseline (State 2)
1. Verify consistent phosphor glow (green-tinted, not pure green)
2. Confirm subtle scanline movement at 1x speed
3. Check occasional single-frame glitches every 3-5 seconds
4. Validate text has slight RGB glow halo
5. Ensure screen curvature is barely noticeable (15% strength)

### Secret Reveal (State 3)
1. Verify ancient symbols overlay at 100% opacity
2. Confirm phosphor glow intensifies to near-white
3. Check scanlines freeze momentarily, then pulse rhythmically like a heartbeat
4. Validate code fragment rendered with custom corona shader
5. Ensure screen brightness increases 20%, vignette darkens to focus attention

### Dreamweaver Selection (State 4)
1. Verify phosphor tint crossfades to thread-specific color over 3 seconds
2. Confirm scanline behavior shifts to match thread personality
3. Check final aesthetic "locks in" with subtle screen shake

## Audio Implementation

### Ambient Foundation
1. Verify CRT hum at 60Hz with harmonics at 120Hz, 180Hz
2. Confirm electrical interference pattern with periodic crackle every 3-7 seconds

### Boot Sequence
1. Verify 56k dialup modem negotiation (3 seconds)
2. Confirm layered telegraph clicks, fax machine tones, dot-matrix printer sounds

### Stable State
1. Verify ghost typing with mechanical typewriter keys every 5-10 seconds
2. Confirm cursor blink tone at 600Hz, 50ms duration, every 0.53 seconds

### Choice Moments
1. Verify selection hover sound with rising pitch from 200Hz to 400Hz over 0.2s
2. Confirm selection confirm sound with mechanical relay click + 800Hz tone burst

### Secret Reveal
1. Verify 4-second audio buildup with CRT hum increase, sub-bass drone, modem tones, ghost typewriters
2. Confirm sudden silence (0.3s) followed by Tibetan singing bowl tone
3. Validate each code symbol punctuates with different overtone

### Dreamweaver Lock-In
1. Verify 3-second crossfade of CRT hum modulating to thread frequency
2. Confirm final lock sound with mechanical vault lock turning and heavy metallic *thunk*

## Player Experience

### Input Methods
1. Verify mouse hover highlights choices
2. Confirm left-click to select, arrow keys to navigate, Enter to confirm, Escape to go back
3. Validate visual feedback with highlight outline + soft glow on hover

### Choice Button Design
1. Verify icon representation for each thread (Light: ☀, Shadow: ☽, Ambition: ⚡)
2. Confirm text content word-wrapped, left-aligned
3. Validate affinity bar showing thread preference

### Accessibility
1. Verify high contrast mode option (black background, white text)
2. Confirm adjustable text size options
3. Validate dyslexia-friendly font option
4. Ensure large click targets (minimum 48px height per choice)
5. Verify focus indicators are 2px minimum, high contrast

## Game Flow

### Boot Sequence
1. Verify no choices during boot sequence
2. Confirm player cannot skip boot sequence
3. Validate press any key to continue after "...how many times must I ask..."

### Opening Monologue
1. Verify auto-advances between lines (2.5s pause between)
2. Confirm player can press Space to speed up (but not skip entirely)
3. Validate final line "The ones who were chosen." holds until player acknowledges

### Choice Presentation
1. Verify question prompt with context
2. Confirm 3 choice options displayed as buttons
3. Validate each choice aligned with a Dreamweaver philosophy
4. Ensure choice fades out, response fades in (smooth transition)

### Secret Fragment Reveal
1. Verify 4-second audio buildup MUST complete
2. Confirm disable all input during symbol reveal
3. Validate symbols appear one at a time (cannot rush)
4. Ensure display: "[Press any key to acknowledge]" after all 5 symbols visible
5. Verify game continues only after key press
