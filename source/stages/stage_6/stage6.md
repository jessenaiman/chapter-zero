# Stage 6 · System Log Epilogue

Closing tableau for Act I. The triumphant bridge moment glitches into a cold system log that finishes the tale the Dreamweavers cannot control, then hard-cuts to the Omega Spiral logo in deep space.

## Creative Snapshot

- **Fantasy**: The simulation crashes gracefully. A neutral narrator—part myth, part error handler—delivers a hero scroll that admits every path loops back here.
- **Structure**: Interactive options fade; player watches the log unfurl while background art disintegrates into black starfield. Final beat tees up animated credits / Act II teaser.

## Content & Data

- Data file: `res://Source/Stages/Stage6/stage6.json`
- Schema: reuse `res://Source/Data/Schemas/narrative_terminal_schema.json` until a dedicated epilogue schema is authored.
- Scene: Minimal Godot scene with log text overlay, glitch shaders, and Omega Spiral logo reveal.

## Narrative Beats

1. **Log Initiation** – System voice overrides Dreamweaver chatter: “ARCHIVE // HERO LOOP 000847295 // FINAL WRITE.”
2. **Hero Essay** – Interleaved prose + metadata references:
   - Frodo-style reluctance: “He wished another bore the ring, yet footsteps answered regardless.”
   - Bastion’s hunger: “She stole the book because stories choose the thief who opens them.”
   - Bold confrontation: “They stepped toward the darkness because someone must face it by name.”
3. **Inevitable Loop** – Log states: “All vectors converge. Infinity is a spiral, not a circle.”
4. **Crash Cascade** – Background layers pop off, timer hits zero, residual Dreamweaver VO degrades into bitcrush.
5. **Final Image** – Only the Omega Spiral logo remains against space while the log prints “// Await continuation signal.”

## Implementation Checklist

1. Author ordered log entries in `stage6.json`, including glitches (`[ERROR 0xFF]`) and narrator prose.
2. Script timed visual breakdowns triggered by log entry IDs.
3. Fade-in Omega Spiral logo + “Coming Soon” banner once log completes.
4. Persist key stats (Dreamweaver alignment, Stage 5 route) into save payload for Act II prototype.

## QA / Validation

- Verify log pacing matches audio and visual breakdown cues.
- Confirm no player input required after Stage 5 convergence; this is pure denouement.
- Ensure Act II handoff data (alignment, route, countdown performance) is present before credits roll.
