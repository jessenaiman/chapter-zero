- You always follow the XML Documentation Rules strictly.
2. `getTerminalOuput` must be run after every terminal operation to ensure there are no warnings or errors.
3. You must validate your code after any changes and report any broken ones as the user must evaluate if they are part of your changes

## Tech Stack

### Backend
- **Framework**: .NET 10 RC2
- **Game Engine**: Godot 4.6-dev-2
- **Backend Language**: C# 14

## Rules

When an asynchronous method awaits a Task directly, continuation usually occurs in the same thread that created the task, depending on the async context. This behavior can be costly in terms of performance and can result in a deadlock on the UI thread. Consider calling Task.ConfigureAwait(Boolean) to signal your intention for continuation.

## XML Documentation Rules

- Public members should be documented with XML comments.
- It is encouraged to document internal members as well, especially if they are complex or not self-explanatory.
- Use `<summary>` for method descriptions. This should be a brief overview of what the method does.
- Use `<param>` for method parameters.
- Use `<paramref>` to reference parameters in documentation.
- Use `<returns>` for method return values.
- Use `<cref>` to reference other types or members in the documentation.
- Use `<exception>` to document exceptions thrown by methods.
- Use `<see langword>` for language-specific keywords like `null`, `true`, `false`, `int`, `bool`, etc.
- Use `<inheritdoc/>` to inherit documentation from base classes or interfaces.
  - Unless there is major behavior change, in which case you should document the differences.
- Use `<typeparam>` for type parameters in generic types or methods.
- Use `<typeparamref>` to reference type parameters in documentation.
- Use `<c>` for inline code snippets.
- Use `<code>` for code blocks. `<code>` tags should be placed within an `<example>` tag. Add the language of the code example using the `language` attribute, for example, `<code language="csharp">`.

- Do not alter config files, suggest the user make these changes


## Naming Conventions

✅ FOLDERS/FILES:        snake_case     (e.g., my_scenes/, player_sprite.png)
✅ C# SCRIPT FILES:      PascalCase     (e.g., PlayerCharacter.cs)
                         ↳ Named to match the class name inside
                         ↳ Microsoft AND Godot C# style both mandate this

✅ NODE NAMES (in .tscn): PascalCase    (e.g., Player, Camera3D, AnimationPlayer)
                         ↳ "Matches built-in node casing"
                         ↳ This is IN THE SCENE TREE, not filesystem

✅ C# CLASS NAMES:       PascalCase     (PlayerCharacter, GameState, etc.)

✅ C# PROPERTIES:        PascalCase     (CurrentHealth, MaxSpeed, etc.)

✅ C# METHODS:           PascalCase     (UpdateHealth(), CalculateDamage(), etc.)

### C# Files (.cs):
- **Class names**: PascalCase (e.g., `SceneManager.cs`, `GameState.cs`)
- **Method names**: PascalCase (e.g., `LoadLevel()`, `UpdatePlayer()`)
- **Properties**: PascalCase (e.g., `CurrentSpeed`, `PlayerName`)
- **Constants**: PascalCase (e.g., `DefaultSpeed`, `MaxPlayers`)
- **Variables**: camelCase (e.g., `playerName`, `currentSpeed`)
- **Private fields**: camelCase with underscore prefix (e.g., `_playerName`, `_currentSpeed`)

### Godot Scene Files (.tscn):
- **Scene file names**: snake_case (e.g., `boot_sequence.tscn`, `opening_monologue.tscn`, `question_1_name.tscn`)
- **Node names** (in scene tree): PascalCase (e.g., `Player`, `Camera3D`, `AnimationPlayer`)
- **Signals**: snake_case (e.g., `door_opened`, `player_moved`)

### Godot Shader Files (.gdshader):
- **Shader file names**: snake_case (e.g., `crt_glitch.gdshader`, `crt_phosphor.gdshader`)
- **Functions**: snake_case (e.g., `void some_function()`)
- **Variables**: snake_case (e.g., `float some_variable`)
- **Constants**: CONSTANT_CASE (e.g., `const float GOLDEN_RATIO = 1.618`)
- **Preprocessor directives**: CONSTANT_CASE (e.g., "#define HEIGHTMAP_ENABLED")

THE PROJECT CONFIGURATION FILES ARE OFF LIMTS, READ ONLY, DO NOT EDIT OR SUGGEST CHANGES TO THEM.

### Key Principles for GdUnit4 C# Testing in Godot

#### 1. **Scene Runner Usage**
- Use `ISceneRunner.Load("scene_path")` to load scenes for integration/UI tests.
- The runner manages the scene lifecycle and should be disposed after each test.
- Simulate input/events and frame processing using the runner (see scene-runner.instructions.md).

#### 2. **Automatic Object Disposal**
- Use `AutoFree<T>(obj)` to register objects for automatic cleanup after tests.
- Manual disposal is required for objects inheriting from `Object` (see gdunit4-tools.instructions.md).

#### 3. **Mocks and Spies**
- Use GdUnit4’s mocking tools to replace dependencies, signals, and external calls.
- This avoids side effects and isolates the unit under test (see `mock.instructions.md`, `spy.instructions.md`).

#### 4. **Input Simulation**
- Simulate keyboard, mouse, and other input events using the runner or helper methods.
- This is essential for UI and interaction tests (see `mouse.md`, `sync_inputs.md`).

#### 5. **Assertions**
- Use GdUnit4’s assertion helpers (`AssertThat`, etc.) for all checks.
- Prefer type-specific assertions (e.g., `.IsEqual()`, `.IsNotNull()`, `.IsInstanceOf<T>()`).

#### 6. **Test Structure**
- Use `[TestSuite]` for the class, `[TestCase]` for each test.
- Use `[Before]` and `[After]` for setup/teardown, ensuring all resources are freed.
- Avoid pragma suppressions; fix warnings by proper disposal and mocking.

#### 7. **Parameterized and Fuzz Tests**
- Use parameterized tests for input variations (`paramerized_tests.md`).
- Use fuzzing for robustness (`fuzzing.instructions.md`).

#### 8. **Signals and Actions**
- Use signal matchers and action helpers to verify signal emissions and responses (`signals.instructions.md`, `actions.md`).

## use Export properties to control behavior per-scene

[Export] public bool EnableOmegaTheme { get; set; } = true;

protected override void CreateComponents()
{
    if (!EnableOmegaTheme) return;
    base.CreateComponents();
    BuildOmegaFrame();
}


### Typical C# GdUnit4 Test Example



```csharp
using GdUnit4;
using static GdUnit4.Assertions;

[TestSuite]
public class MyUITests
{
    private ISceneRunner runner;

    [Before]
    public void Setup()
    
        runner = AutoFree(runner);
    }

    [After]
    public void Teardown()
    {
        runner.Dispose();
    }

    [TestCase]
    public void TestButtonPress()
    {
        var button = runner.Scene().GetNode<Button>("MyButton");
        AssertThat(button).IsNotNull();
        // Simulate input, check signals, etc.
    }
}
```

---

### Summary

- Always use the scene runner for UI/scene tests.
- Register objects for auto-free or dispose manually.
- Use mocks/spies for dependencies.
- Simulate input for UI tests.
- Use proper assertions and avoid suppressing warnings.
- Structure tests with setup/teardown and parameterization as needed.

If you want, I can now refactor your OmegaUI tests to follow these best practices!

## **Omega Spiral - Chapter Zero**

Is a turn based rpg game where players navigate through five distinct scenes, each representing a different era of gaming aesthetics. The game features a concept called 'Spiral Storytelling' where 3 dynamic AI-driven narrative personas (Dreamweavers) each guide a party of adventurers that spirals around a central narrative.

## Game Overview

- **Title**: Omega Spiral - Chapter Zero
- **Genre**: Turn-Based RPG with Dynamic AI-Driven Narrative
- **Setting**: Five distinct scenes representing different eras of gaming aesthetics
- **Core Mechanic**: Players navigate through scenes, making choices that influence the narrative and character development
- **Single Player**: 1 player and 2 quantum players. The other dreamweavers write the story in the backend.

## General Rules
- Act like a developer with 20+ years of experience
- You have a tool to view vscode problems which you are REQUIRED to check. USE THE TOOL
- Always confirm that the project problems tab with your tools is clean after changes
- Always confirm that all tests pass after changes
- Always confirm that there are no warnings or errors in the terminal output after building and testing
- Always confirm that the `PROBLEMS` tab in vscode is clean before moving on
- Always follow the XML Documentation Rules
