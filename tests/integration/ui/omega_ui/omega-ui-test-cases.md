Of course. A crucial base component like `OmegaUi` requires a rigorous and multi-faceted testing strategy to ensure its stability, reliability, and flexibility. A professional evaluation should cover everything from isolated logic (unit tests) to its behavior within the Godot engine (integration tests) and its intended usage patterns.

Here is a recommended set of robust test cases, categorized by their purpose.

### Recommended Testing Framework

For C# in Godot, the **GdUnit4** framework is highly recommended. It provides a test runner within the Godot editor and offers features for scene-based testing, mocking, and assertions, making it ideal for the tests below.

---

### 1. Unit Tests (Logic Validation)

**Goal:** To test the C# logic of the `OmegaUi` class in isolation, with minimal dependency on a running Godot scene. This often involves mocking its dependencies (`IOmegaShaderController`, `IOmegaTextRenderer`).

| Test Case ID | Description | Arrange (Given) | Act (When) | Assert (Then) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **UT-INIT-01** | **Component Creation (Full)** | `OmegaUi` has valid node references for a shader layer and a text display. | `CreateComponents()` is called. | `CreateShaderController` and `CreateTextRenderer` are both called. `ShaderController` and `TextRenderer` properties are not null. |
| **UT-INIT-02** | **Component Creation (Partial)** | `OmegaUi` only has a valid node reference for a text display. | `CreateComponents()` is called. | `CreateTextRenderer` is called. `TextRenderer` is not null. `ShaderController` is null. |
| **UT-INIT-03** | **Component Creation (Factory Failure)** | The `CreateShaderController` method is mocked to return `null`. | `CreateComponents()` is called. | An `InvalidOperationException` is thrown with a specific error message. |
| **UT-API-01** | **API Delegation (AppendText)** | `OmegaUi` has a mocked `IOmegaTextRenderer`. | `AppendTextAsync()` is called. | The mock's `AppendTextAsync()` method is called with the exact same parameters. |
| **UT-API-02** | **API Graceful Failure (AppendText)** | The `TextRenderer` component is `null`. | `AppendTextAsync()` is called. | No exception is thrown. A warning is pushed to Godot's logger (`GD.PushWarning`). The method returns immediately. |
| **UT-API-03** | **API Delegation (ApplyVisualPreset)** | `OmegaUi` has a mocked `IOmegaShaderController`. | `ApplyVisualPresetAsync()` is called. | The mock's `ApplyVisualPresetAsync()` method is called with the exact same parameters. |
| **UT-API-04** | **API Graceful Failure (ApplyVisualPreset)** | The `ShaderController` component is `null`. | `ApplyVisualPresetAsync()` is called. | No exception is thrown. A warning is pushed to Godot's logger. |
| **UT-DISP-01** | **Dispose Pattern** | `OmegaUi` has mock `IDisposable` components. | `Dispose()` is called. | The `Dispose()` method on both mock components is called. Internal component references are set to `null`. |
| **UT-DISP-02** | **Multiple Disposals** | `OmegaUi` instance is created. | `Dispose()` is called twice. | The underlying disposal logic and component `Dispose()` methods are only executed once. |

---

### 2. Integration Tests (In-Engine Validation)

**Goal:** To test the `OmegaUi` component within a live Godot scene. This validates its interaction with the scene tree, node lifecycle, and exported properties. These tests require creating simple scenes specifically for testing.

| Test Case ID | Description | Arrange (Given) | Act (When) | Assert (Then) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **IT-NODE-01** | **NodePath Wiring (Happy Path)** | A test scene with `OmegaUi` and all required child nodes (`RichTextLabel`, `ColorRects`). All `NodePath` properties are correctly assigned in the Inspector. | The scene is loaded into the tree. | After `_Ready`, the internal node references (`_textDisplay`, `_phosphorLayer`, etc.) are not null. |
| **IT-NODE-02** | **NodePath Wiring (Missing Path)** | A test scene where `TextDisplayPath` is left unassigned. | The scene is loaded. | After `_Ready`, `_textDisplay` is null, and `_textRenderer` is null. No errors are thrown. |
| **IT-NODE-03** | **NodePath Wiring (Invalid Path)** | A test scene where `TextDisplayPath` points to a node that does not exist. | The scene is loaded. | After `_Ready`, `GetNodeOrNull` returns null, `_textDisplay` is null, and no errors are thrown. |
| **IT-NODE-04** | **NodePath Wiring (Wrong Type)** | A test scene where `TextDisplayPath` is assigned to a `ColorRect` node instead of a `RichTextLabel`. | The scene is loaded. | After `_Ready`, `GetNodeOrNull<RichTextLabel>` returns null, `_textDisplay` is null, and no errors are thrown. |
| **IT-LIFE-01** | **Initialization Lifecycle** | A test scene containing the `OmegaUi` node. | The scene is added to the tree using `AddChild()`. | `_Ready()` is called, and components are initialized as expected based on the scene configuration. |
| **IT-LIFE-02** | **Cleanup Lifecycle** | A test scene with a running `OmegaUi` node. | The `OmegaUi` node is removed from the tree using `QueueFree()`. | `_ExitTree()` is called, and the `Dispose()` method is triggered, successfully cleaning up resources. |
| **IT-SHADER-01**| **Primary Shader Layer Resolution**| A scene with only `ScanlineLayer` and `GlitchLayer` nodes wired up. `PhosphorLayer` is null. | The scene is loaded. | `ResolvePrimaryShaderLayer()` correctly returns the `ScanlineLayer` node, and the `ShaderController` is created with it. |
