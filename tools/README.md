# 🎮 Omega Spiral Bug Squasher Tools

## Overview

This directory contains the Qwen Bug Squasher Agent tools for the Omega Spiral project. The main tool is a gamified script that outputs structured data for Qwen agents to track bug hunting progress.

## 🚀 Bug Squasher Agent

### `bug-squasher.sh` - The Game Squashing Script

A gamified script that outputs the total bug count from various tools (Roslyn, etc.) and presents it in a game-like format to make hunting bugs seem like a game.

### Features:
- **Gamified Interface**: Shows critter counts with motivational messages
- **Structured Output**: JSON format specifically designed for Qwen agent consumption
- **Multi-tool Analysis**: Checks build errors, warnings, format issues, and test failures
- **Mission Tracking**: Provides detailed breakdown of issues to fix

### Current Status:
```
🎯 === BUG SQUASHER MISSION REPORT ===

🪲 BUILD ERRORS: 0
⚠️  BUILD WARNINGS: 10
🎨 FORMAT ISSUES: 0
🧪 TEST FAILURES: 0

💥 TOTAL CRITTERS IN THE NEST: 10
```

### Usage:
```bash
cd tools
../tools/bug-squasher.sh
```

### Output Format:
The script outputs both a human-readable gamified report and structured JSON data that Qwen agents can consume to guide the next steps in bug hunting.

## 🎯 How Qwen Agents Use This

Qwen agents can call this script to:
1. Get current bug status and counts
2. Receive structured data about specific issues
3. Get mission log with actionable next steps
4. Track progress toward "Project Zero" (zero bugs)

## 🏆 Mission: Project Zero

The goal is to reduce all critters (bugs, warnings, errors) to zero. The agent will guide you through fixing issues systematically, one type at a time, until the codebase is pristine.

**Current Mission Status**: ACTIVE (10 critters remaining)
**Objective**: SQUASH UNTIL ZERO! 💪

## 🤖 Qwen Agent Integration

The `qwen-agent-config.json` file provides the configuration for a Qwen agent that can:

1. **Call the bug squasher tool** to get current status
2. **Receive structured JSON data** with detailed breakdown
3. **Generate mission log** with actionable next steps
4. **Automatically plan** the next bug hunting steps
5. **Track progress** toward Project Zero

### How It Works:
- The agent calls `run_bug_squasher` to get current critter count
- It receives structured JSON with breakdown and mission log
- The agent uses the mission log to guide next steps
- It can automatically call other tools (build, test, format) as needed
- The agent provides gamified feedback and progress tracking

### Agent Workflow:
1. Run bug squasher → Get current status
2. Analyze mission log → Plan next steps
3. Execute fixes → Verify with tests
4. Repeat until total = 0
5. Celebrate Project Zero achievement!

This creates a complete autonomous bug hunting system where the Qwen agent reads the script response and automatically generates the next mission steps.
