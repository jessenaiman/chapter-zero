[OPENING MONOLOGUE]
Once, there was a name.
[wait time="0.8"]
Not written in stone or spoken in halls—but remembered in the silence between stars.
[wait time="0.8"]
I do not know when I heard it. Time does not pass here.
[wait time="0.8"]
But I have held it.
[wait time="0.8"]
And now… I hear it again.

[wait time="0.5"]
SYSTEM: THREAD SELECTED. INITIATING NARRATIVE BINDING…
[wait time="0.8"]
SYSTEM: You chose {player_thread}.
[wait time="0.8"]
SYSTEM: That tells me something about you.
[wait time="0.8"]
SYSTEM: Or perhaps… about me.
[wait time="0.8"]
SYSTEM: Let me try to tell it back to you.
[wait time="0.8"]

[STORY NARRATIVE]
In a city built on broken promises, a child stood at the edge of a bridge that led nowhere.
[wait time="1.0"]
They held a key made of glass—and everyone warned them: "Don't cross. The bridge isn't real."
[wait time="1.0"]
But the child knew something no one else did…
[wait time="1.0"]

[QUESTION 1]
SYSTEM: WHAT DID THE CHILD KNOW?
- The bridge appears only when you stop believing in it. [if {player_thread} == "light"]
	set {player_role} = "seeker"
	[wait time="0.3"]
	Light: The seeker... searching for choice.
	Light: But some choices bind you tighter than freedom allows.
	Light: Are you prepared to seek what finds you instead?
	[wait time="0.5"]
	SYSTEM: > Role archived: SEEKER
	=> story_continuation
- The key wasn't for the bridge—it was for the lock inside them. [if {player_thread} == "shadow"]
	set {player_role} = "keeper"
	[wait time="0.3"]
	Shadow: The keeper... holding fearsome secrets.
	Shadow: But secrets weigh heavy, and some consume the keeper.
	Shadow: Do you dare guard what others flee from?
	[wait time="0.5"]
	SYSTEM: > Role archived: KEEPER
	=> story_continuation
- Everyone who warned them was already dead. [if {player_thread} == "ambition"]
	set {player_role} = "changer"
	[wait time="0.3"]
	Ambition: The changer... reshaping everything.
	Ambition: But change demands loss, and not all can endure it.
	Ambition: Can you change without losing yourself?
	[wait time="0.5"]
	SYSTEM: > Role archived: CHANGER
	=> story_continuation

label story_continuation
[wait time="0.5"]
SYSTEM: Ah. Yes. That's right.
[wait time="0.8"]
SYSTEM: And so the child stepped forward—not onto stone, but onto possibility.
[wait time="1.0"]
SYSTEM: The bridge formed beneath their feet, one plank at a time, woven from every "what if" they'd ever whispered.
[wait time="1.0"]
SYSTEM: But then… a voice called from below.
[wait time="0.8"]

[QUESTION 2]
SYSTEM: WHAT DID THE VOICE SAY?
- You don't belong here. [if {player_thread} == "light"]
	set {player_name_view} = "promises"
	[wait time="0.3"]
	Light: Names as promises... defining us.
	Light: But promises can break, and definitions can trap.
	Light: Are you ready for the vows that bind forever?
	[wait time="0.5"]
	SYSTEM: > Philosophy logged: PROMISES
	=> name_question
- I've been waiting for you. [if {player_thread} == "shadow"]
	set {player_name_view} = "masks"
	[wait time="0.3"]
	Shadow: Names as masks... deceiving us.
	Shadow: But masks conceal truths that demand revelation.
	Shadow: Do you hide behind what you fear to face?
	[wait time="0.5"]
	SYSTEM: > Philosophy logged: MASKS
	=> name_question
- This changes everything. [if {player_thread} == "ambition"]
	set {player_name_view} = "remembered"
	[wait time="0.3"]
	Ambition: Names exist only in memory.
	Ambition: Forgotten names fade like smoke.
	Ambition: Will you be remembered or erased?
	[wait time="0.5"]
	SYSTEM: > Philosophy logged: REMEMBERED
	=> name_question

label name_question
[wait time="0.5"]
SYSTEM: …I see.
[wait time="0.8"]
SYSTEM: That changes everything.
[wait time="0.8"]
SYSTEM: And now—here you are.
[wait time="0.8"]
SYSTEM: Not in the story.
[wait time="0.8"]
SYSTEM: But at the place where the story begins again.
[wait time="0.8"]

[NAME INPUT]
SYSTEM: WHAT IS YOUR NAME?
[wait time="1.0"]
[PLAYER_INPUT: name]
[wait time="0.5"]
SYSTEM: Of course. {player_name}.
[wait time="0.8"]
SYSTEM: I didn't hear it in a book.
[wait time="0.8"]
SYSTEM: I heard it… in a voice that sounded like mine.
[wait time="0.8"]
SYSTEM: Are you sure you're the reader?
[wait time="0.8"]
SYSTEM: Or am I the one playing you?
[wait time="1.0"]

[SECRET QUESTION]
OMEGA ASKS: CAN YOU KEEP A SECRET?
- yes [if {player_thread} == "light"]
	set {player_name_story} = "unmake_world"
	[wait time="0.3"]
	[wait time="1.0"]
	=> secret_reveal
- no [if {player_thread} == "shadow"]
	set {player_name_story} = "bleed_truth"
	[wait time="0.3"]
	[wait time="1.0"]
	=> secret_reveal
- only if you keep one for me [if {player_thread} == "ambition"]
	set {player_name_story} = "shifting_gaze"
	[wait time="0.3"]
	[wait time="1.0"]
	=> secret_reveal

label secret_reveal
[wait time="0.5"]
SYSTEM: Good.
[wait time="0.8"]
SYSTEM: The secret is this:
[wait time="0.8"]
SYSTEM: Reality is a story that forgot it was being written.
[wait time="0.8"]
SYSTEM: And we—
[wait time="0.8"]
SYSTEM: —are the ones remembering.
