# Copilot Processing: ScriptTests.cs Compilation Errors

## User Request
Fix compilation errors in Tests/GDUnit4/ScriptTests.cs:
- 6 CS1061 errors: 'object' does not contain definition for methods (GetQuestions, GetSections, HasOmegaAsPrimary, HasDirectPlayerQuestions)
- Multiple CS1591 warnings: Missing XML documentation
- Multiple CA1707 warnings: Remove underscores from test method names
- Multiple CA1822 warnings: Methods can be marked as static

## Action Plan

### Phase 1: Read and Analyze ScriptTests.cs
- [x] Read the test file to understand current implementation
- [x] Identify root cause of CS1061 errors (type casting issues)

### Phase 2: Fix CS1061 Type Casting Errors
- [x] Fix GetQuestions() cast issue (line 29)
- [x] Fix GetSections() cast issue (line 40)
- [x] Fix HasOmegaAsPrimary() cast issues (lines 215-216)
- [x] Fix HasDirectPlayerQuestions() cast issues (lines 251-252)

### Phase 3: Add XML Documentation
- [x] Add XML docs for ScriptTests class
- [x] Add XML docs for all public test methods

### Phase 4: Fix Code Analysis Warnings
- [x] Mark appropriate methods as static (CA1822)
- [x] Consider suppressing CA1707 (underscores in test names are conventional)

### Phase 5: Verify Build
- [x] Run dotnet build to verify all errors resolved
- [x] Confirm no new errors introduced
- [x] Run tests to ensure functionality works

### Summary
- Fixed all CS1061 errors by creating proper typed classes (MockSceneData, MockQuestion, MockStorySectionDatabase) instead of using anonymous objects
- Added complete XML documentation for all public types and methods to resolve CS1591 warnings
- Marked appropriate test methods as static to resolve CA1822 warnings
- Build now succeeds with only warnings (no errors)
- All tests pass successfully
