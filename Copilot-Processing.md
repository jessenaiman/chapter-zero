# Copilot Processing Log

## User Request Details

- **Date**: October 10, 2025
- **User Instruction**: That's good. We need to fix all the issues. Creates a todos checklist for the categories and work through them until we can push the code with a process that is effective and gives us the code quality we need
- **Primary Goal**: Fix all 319 code analysis errors blocking commits, categorized by type, to enable clean commits and pushes with enforced quality gates.
- **Additional Context**: Build shows 319 errors including nullability, style, code quality, culture, async, and other issues across multiple files. Pre-commit hook successfully blocks commits with errors, now need to systematically fix all issues.

#### Context Highlights

- Implementation plan template remains uncustomizedâ€”must infer architecture from other docs and actual code.
- Data model defines GameState-driven persistence, Dreamweaver scoring, and JSON-backed scenes with schema validation via contracts directory.
- Research confirms stack (Godot 4.5 Mono, C# 14, .NET 10 RC) and performance targets (60 FPS, transitions <500ms, JSON loads <100ms).
- Quickstart reiterates five-scene flow (Narrative â†’ ASCII Dungeon â†’ Party Creation â†’ Tile Dungeon â†’ Pixel Combat) and testing expectations (NUnit, Godot integration).

### Phase C â€“ Task Structure Analysis

- [X] Extract phases (Setup, Tests, Core, Integration, Polish) and any foundational sequencing
- [X] Map dependencies and identify sequential vs parallel markers
- [X] List each task with ID, description, target files, and current checkbox state

## NobodyWho LLM Integration Research & Planning

### Date: October 9, 2025

### Research Summary

**Objective**: Investigate [nobodywho-ooo/nobodywho](https://github.com/nobodywho-ooo/nobodywho) for implementing dynamic, LLM-powered Dreamweaver personas.

**Key Findings**:

1. **NobodyWho Framework**:
   - Godot 4.x native plugin for local LLM integration
   - Supports GGUF model format (llama.cpp backend)
   - GPU-accelerated inference (Vulkan/Metal)
   - Provides `NobodyWhoChat`, `NobodyWhoModel`, `NobodyWhoEmbedding` nodes
   - Tool calling support for game system integration
   - Structured output (JSON) via grammar enforcement

2. **Architecture Alignment**:
   - Fits perfectly with existing `NarrativeTerminal.cs` system
   - Can wrap three Dreamweaver personas + Omega narrator
   - Each persona = separate `NobodyWhoChat` node with unique system prompt
   - Shared `NobodyWhoModel` node for memory efficiency
   - JSON response parsing aligns with current data-driven design

3. **Recommended Model**: Qwen3-4B-Q4_K_M.gguf (~2.5GB)
   - Supports tool calling (needed for game state queries)
   - Good quality/performance balance
   - Alternative: Qwen3-0.6B for faster performance, Qwen3-14B for quality

4. **Integration Strategy**:
   - Create `DreamweaverSystem.cs` to orchestrate three personas + Omega
   - Create `DreamweaverPersona.cs` wrapper for C#/GDScript bridge
   - Enhance `NarrativeTerminal.cs` with LLM consultation flow
   - Maintain hybrid mode: LLM + static JSON fallback

### Deliverables Created

- [X] Highlight tasks already marked complete that require verification

Key findings:

- Phases 1â€“8 (Setup through Cross-Scene State) are fully checkboxed, implying prior completion; Phase 9 (Polish) still has several unchecked tasks (T099, T100, T092, T093, T094, T101).
- Numerous optional test tasks (T027, T028, T041, T042, T055, T056, T069, T070) remain unchecked; core implementations rely solely on existing tests T014/T015/T083/T084.
- User story scenes (Scene1â€“Scene5) are marked complete; need validation of gameplay (first scene not observed) and automated test pass status.
- Final performance, asset pipeline, additional tests, and coverage validation were left incompleteâ€”must assess necessity vs scope.

### Phase D â€“ Execution & Verification

- [X] D1 â€“ Re-assess Scene1 narrative assets and confirm data files cover hero/shadow/ambition variants (Spec review)
- [X] D2 â€“ Update `Source/UI/NarrativeTerminal.tscn` to deliver modern terminal aesthetic with layered depth cues
- [X] D3 â€“ Refactor `Source/Scripts/NarrativeTerminal.cs` to reduce complexity, support branching, and unblock progression
- [X] D4 â€“ Smoke test first scene in Godot editor to confirm Scene1 loads; resolved parse and style override errors
- [ ] D5 â€“ Re-run relevant .NET unit/integration tests for narrative flow and persistence
- [ ] D6 â€“ Update `tasks.md` checkboxes for any newly completed work (with evidence)
- [ ] D7 â€“ Revisit incomplete checklists items touched by work and record outcomes/questions

### Phase E â€“ Validation & Documentation

- [ ] Perform comprehensive test suite run and capture results
- [ ] Conduct quality gates: build, lint/typecheck, targeted smoke test for first-scene load if feasible
- [ ] Finalize documentation updates (notes, ADRs) if required by tasks
- [ ] Record progress and completion summary for user handoff
- [ ] Prepare final response with requirements coverage and next steps

## Current Status

Phase 1: Initialization - Completed
Phase 2: Planning - Completed
