# Copilot Processing Log

## User Request
Address the SA1101 StyleCop warning which requires prefixing local calls with "this". This means that all field and property access within the class should be prefixed with "this." for clarity and consistency.

Focus on all the domain model files that were recently created:
- Source/Scripts/domain/models/CharacterClass.cs
- Source/Scripts/domain/models/CharacterAppearance.cs
- Source/Scripts/domain/models/CharacterStats.cs
- Source/Scripts/domain/models/CharacterPreset.cs
- Source/Scripts/domain/models/CharacterImportData.cs
- Source/Scripts/domain/models/CharacterExportData.cs
- Source/Scripts/domain/models/InventoryImportData.cs
- Source/Scripts/domain/SignalManager.cs
- Source/Scripts/domain/models/Character.cs
- Source/Scripts/domain/models/EquipmentStats.cs
- Source/Scripts/domain/models/Inventory.cs
- Source/Scripts/domain/models/InventoryExportData.cs
- Source/Scripts/domain/models/InventoryPreset.cs
- And any other domain model files that were created

For each file, ensure that:
1. All private field access is prefixed with "this."
2. All property access is prefixed with "this."
3. All method calls within the same class are prefixed with "this."
4. Only exception is when it would create ambiguity (like in constructors where parameters have the same name as fields)

This should resolve the SA1101 StyleCop warnings.

## Action Plan
1. Examine each domain model file to identify field/property access that needs "this." prefix
2. Update each file to add the required prefixes
3. Verify build works after each change
4. Continue until all files are processed
