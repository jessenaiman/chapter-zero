## Current Action Plan â€“ Speckit Implementation

### Phase 1 â€“ Speckit Initialization
- [x] Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` and capture FEATURE_DIR plus AVAILABLE_DOCS (dependency: repo root shell access).
- [x] Normalize parsed paths to absolute values and record in workspace notes (dependency: script output).

### Phase 2 â€“ Checklist Assessment
- [x] Inspect `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/` for checklist markdown files (dependency: Phase 1 FEATURE_DIR).
- [x] Compute completion stats per checklist and render status table in response (dependency: checklist scan).
- [x] If any incomplete items exist, pause execution pending user approval (dependency: status table).

### Phase 3 â€“ Context Loading

- [x] Read `tasks.md` for full task inventory (dependency: Phase 1 paths).
- [x] Read `plan.md` for architecture and tech stack expectations.
- [x] Optionally read `data-model.md`, `contracts/`, `research.md`, `quickstart.md` if present.

### Phase 4 â€“ File Verification
- [x] Determine project tooling signals (git repo, Docker, ESLint, Prettier, npm, Terraform, Helm) per Speckit rules.
- [x] Create or update ignore files with required patterns; append only missing essentials (dependency: detection results).
- [x] Document modifications for Codacy analysis triggers (dependency: file edits).

### Phase 5 â€“ Task Structure Extraction
- [x] Parse `tasks.md` into phases (Setup, Tests, Core, Integration, Polish) noting sequential/parallel markers.
- [x] Capture task IDs, descriptions, target files, dependency relationships for execution tracking.

### Phase 6 â€“ Execution Workflow
- [ ] Follow tasks phase-by-phase respecting dependencies, prioritizing test tasks before implementation.
- [ ] Update `tasks.md` checkboxes upon task completion with supporting evidence references.
- [ ] Maintain progress notes in Copilot log for each completed task grouping.

### Phase 7 â€“ Validation & Reporting
- [ ] Run mandated tests/build commands verifying changes meet specs.
- [ ] Execute Codacy analysis per modified file immediately after each edit.
- [ ] Produce final summary with validation results and next steps.

### Current Session Notes â€“ October 11, 2025
- **FEATURE_DIR**: `/home/adam/Dev/omega-spiral/chapter-zero/specs/004-implement-omega-spiral`
- **AVAILABLE_DOCS**: `research.md`, `data-model.md`, `contracts/`, `quickstart.md`, `tasks.md`
- **User Approval**: Continue implementation despite incomplete checklists (confirmed October 11, 2025).
- **Context Loaded**: `tasks.md`, `plan.md`, `data-model.md`, `research.md`, `quickstart.md` reviewed.
- **Build Attempt 2025-10-11 (Initial)**: `dotnet build` failed with 83 errors (duplicate partial class members, unsupported exported types, missing types like `SceneManager`).
- **Build Attempt 2025-10-11 (After GDScript Conversion)**: Converted all `.gd` files in Source directory to C#, removed duplicates (DialogueWindow, Trigger). Errors reduced to 67. Remaining issues: missing enum types (CharacterClass, CharacterRace, DreamweaverType, TileType, ObjectType), SceneManager references, ambiguous Timer/Range references.

- [X] Highlight tasks already marked complete that require verification
Key findings:

- Phases 1â€“8 (Setup through Cross-Scene State) are fully checkboxed, implying prior completion; Phase 9 (Polish) still has several unchecked tasks (T099, T100, T092, T093, T094, T101).
- Numerous optional test tasks (T027, T028, T041, T042, T055, T056, T069, T070) remain unchecked; core implementations rely solely on existing tests T014/T015/T083/T084.
- User story scenes (Scene1â€“Scene5) are marked complete; need validation of gameplay (first scene not observed) and automated test pass status.
- Final performance, asset pipeline, additional tests, and coverage validation were left incompleteâ€”must assess necessity vs scope.

### Phase D â€“ Execution & Verification

- [X] D1 â€“ Re-assess Scene1 narrative assets and confirm data files cover hero/shadow/ambition variants (Spec review)
- [X] D2 â€“ Update `Source/UI/NarrativeTerminal.tscn` to deliver modern terminal aesthetic with layered depth cues
- [X] D3 â€“ Refactor `Source/Scripts/NarrativeTerminal.cs` to reduce complexity, support branching, and unblock progression
- [X] D4 â€“ Smoke test first scene in Godot editor to confirm Scene1 loads; resolved parse and style override errors
- [ ] D5 â€“ Re-run relevant .NET unit/integration tests for narrative flow and persistence
- [ ] D6 â€“ Update `tasks.md` checkboxes for any newly completed work (with evidence)
- [ ] D7 â€“ Revisit incomplete checklists items touched by work and record outcomes/questions
- [X] D8 â€“ Execute automated build and launch opening scene to confirm current project state (67 build errors remaining - blocked on missing enum types and SceneManager)

### Phase E â€“ Validation & Documentation

- [ ] Perform comprehensive test suite run and capture results
- [ ] Finalize documentation updates (notes, ADRs) if required by tasks
- [ ] Record progress and completion summary for user handoff
- [ ] Prepare final response with requirements coverage and next steps

## Current Status
Phase 1: Initialization - Completed
Phase 2: Planning - Completed
