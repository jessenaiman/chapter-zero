# Copilot Processing Log

## User Request Details

- **Date**: October 9, 2025
- **User Instruction**: Follow instructions in [speckit.implement.prompt.md](file:///home/adam/Dev/omega-spiral/chapter-zero/.github/prompts/speckit.implement.prompt.md).
- **Primary Goal**: Execute the implementation plan by processing and executing all tasks defined in tasks.md
- **Additional Context**: Current file is /home/adam/Dev/omega-spiral/chapter-zero/specs/004-implement-omega-spiral/tasks.md

## Action Plan

### Preliminary Checks

- [X] Run prerequisite check script: Execute `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` from repo root
- [X] Parse script output: Extract FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list (all paths absolute)
- [X] Check checklists status: Scan all checklist files in FEATURE_DIR/checklists/ directory
- [X] Count checklist items: For each checklist, count total, completed, and incomplete items
- [X] Generate status table: Create table showing checklist status with Total, Completed, Incomplete, Status columns
- [X] Evaluate overall status: Determine if all checklists pass (0 incomplete) or fail (any incomplete)
- [ ] Handle incomplete checklists: If any incomplete, display table and ask user to proceed; wait for response
- [ ] Proceed if allowed: If all pass or user confirms proceed, continue to next step

### Load Implementation Context

- [X] Read tasks.md: Load complete task list and execution plan
- [X] Read plan.md: Load tech stack, architecture, and file structure
- [X] Read data-model.md: If exists, load entities and relationships
- [X] Read contracts/: If exists, load API specifications and test requirements
- [X] Read research.md: If exists, load technical decisions and constraints
- [X] Read quickstart.md: If exists, load integration scenarios

### Parse Tasks Structure

- [X] Extract task phases: Identify Setup, Tests, Core, Integration, Polish phases
- [X] Extract dependencies: Determine sequential vs parallel execution rules
- [X] Extract task details: Parse ID, description, file paths, parallel markers [P]
- [X] Determine execution flow: Establish order and dependency requirements

### Execute Implementation

- [X] Execute Setup phase: Initialize project structure, dependencies, configuration
- [X] Execute Foundational phase: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented
- [X] Execute User Story 1 tests: Contract test for narrative terminal schema validation
- [X] Execute User Story 1 tests: Integration test for state updates
- [X] Execute User Story 3: Party character creation implementation
- [X] Execute User Story 4: Tile dungeon implementation
- [X] Execute User Story 5: Pixel combat implementation
- [X] Execute User Story 6: Cross-scene state management
- [X] Execute User Story 6: Cross-scene state management
- [X] Execute Polish phase: Performance optimization, documentation, testing

### Progress Tracking and Validation

- [ ] Track progress: Report after each completed task
- [ ] Handle errors: Halt on non-parallel task failures, continue with successful parallel tasks
- [ ] Mark tasks complete: Update tasks.md with [X] for completed tasks
- [ ] Validate completion: Verify all required tasks completed, features match spec, tests pass, coverage meets requirements
- [ ] Report final status: Provide summary of completed work

## Current Status

Phase 1: Initialization - Completed
Phase 2: Planning - Completed
