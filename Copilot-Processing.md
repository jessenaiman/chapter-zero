# Copilot Processing Log

## User Request Details

- **Date**: October 9, 2025
- **User Instruction**: Follow instructions in [speckit.implement.prompt.md](file:///home/adam/Dev/omega-spiral/chapter-zero/.github/prompts/speckit.implement.prompt.md).
- **Primary Goal**: Execute the implementation plan by processing and executing all tasks defined in `tasks.md`, ensuring every checked-off task is actually completed.
- **Additional Context**: The first scene has not been observed loading in the application and the tests have not been seen passing; previously checkmarked items in `tasks.md` must be verified and properly handled.

## Action Plan

### Phase A – Prerequisite Verification

- [X] Execute `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks`
- [X] Parse script output to capture absolute `FEATURE_DIR` and `AVAILABLE_DOCS`
- [X] Enumerate checklist files under `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/`
- [X] Count total/completed/incomplete items per checklist and build status table
- [X] Determine overall checklist status and decide whether to proceed (prompt user if failures)

#### Checklist Status Snapshot

| Checklist | Total | Completed | Incomplete | Status |
|-----------|-------|-----------|------------|--------|
| csharp-code-quality.md | 59 | 31 | 28 | ✗ FAIL |
| game-design-quality.md | 59 | 0 | 59 | ✗ FAIL |
| godot-implementation.md | 72 | 72 | 0 | ✓ PASS |
| requirements.md | 16 | 16 | 0 | ✓ PASS |
| technical-requirements.md | 47 | 45 | 2 | ✗ FAIL |

**Overall Status**: ✗ FAIL – multiple checklists contain incomplete items. User requested assistance completing the checklist, authorizing continuation despite failures.

### Phase B – Context Acquisition

- [X] Read `tasks.md` for the full breakdown and previously checked items
- [X] Read `plan.md` for architecture, tech stack, and file guidance
- [X] Read optional context (`data-model.md`, `contracts/`, `research.md`, `quickstart.md`) when present
- [X] Summarize key requirements, tech constraints, and file touchpoints

#### Context Highlights

- Implementation plan template remains uncustomized—must infer architecture from other docs and actual code.
- Data model defines GameState-driven persistence, Dreamweaver scoring, and JSON-backed scenes with schema validation via contracts directory.
- Research confirms stack (Godot 4.5 Mono, C# 14, .NET 10 RC) and performance targets (60 FPS, transitions <500ms, JSON loads <100ms).
- Quickstart reiterates five-scene flow (Narrative → ASCII Dungeon → Party Creation → Tile Dungeon → Pixel Combat) and testing expectations (NUnit, Godot integration).

### Phase C – Task Structure Analysis

- [X] Extract phases (Setup, Tests, Core, Integration, Polish) and any foundational sequencing
- [X] Map dependencies and identify sequential vs parallel markers
- [X] List each task with ID, description, target files, and current checkbox state
- [X] Highlight tasks already marked complete that require verification

Key findings:

- Phases 1–8 (Setup through Cross-Scene State) are fully checkboxed, implying prior completion; Phase 9 (Polish) still has several unchecked tasks (T099, T100, T092, T093, T094, T101).
- Numerous optional test tasks (T027, T028, T041, T042, T055, T056, T069, T070) remain unchecked; core implementations rely solely on existing tests T014/T015/T083/T084.
- User story scenes (Scene1–Scene5) are marked complete; need validation of gameplay (first scene not observed) and automated test pass status.
- Final performance, asset pipeline, additional tests, and coverage validation were left incomplete—must assess necessity vs scope.

### Phase D – Execution & Verification

- [ ] Follow phase order to execute outstanding work, starting with prerequisites from Setup
- [ ] For each task, implement or validate outputs, focusing on missing first scene load and failing tests
- [ ] Re-run relevant tests (unit/integration) and document outcomes
- [ ] Update assets (scenes, scripts) to ensure initial scene loads correctly
- [ ] Mark tasks as complete in `tasks.md` only after verification, including previously checked items

### Phase E – Validation & Documentation

- [ ] Perform comprehensive test suite run and capture results
- [ ] Conduct quality gates: build, lint/typecheck, targeted smoke test for first-scene load if feasible
- [ ] Finalize documentation updates (notes, ADRs) if required by tasks
- [ ] Record progress and completion summary for user handoff
- [ ] Prepare final response with requirements coverage and next steps

## Current Status

Phase 1: Initialization - Completed
Phase 2: Planning - Completed
