The architecture is classic, inviting. A gentle breeze carries the scent of flowers and woodsmoke. It feels... safe. A sense of calm washes over you, but underneath, a nagging feeling persists. A feeling of *déjà vu*, of stories half-remembered. Your party... they were with you, weren't they? You look around. You are alone. The weight of recent choices feels distant, like a fading dream.",
