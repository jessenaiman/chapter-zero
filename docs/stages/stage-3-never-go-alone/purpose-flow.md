# ðŸ§© **Stage 3: Never Go Alone â€“ Mirrors of the Party**

## **Purpose & Narrative Flow**

This stage explores the **player's identity** through the act of **choosing party members**, who serve as **mirrors** of different aspects of the player (or potential paths). Each character choice is followed by a **test** in combat. The initial party is too weak, forcing a return to the "mirror" (character selection) for reinforcement. This cycle repeats until the party is complete (4 members). The final battle is winnable, but regardless of the outcome, the stage concludes and transitions to the next.

## **Creative Concepts**

* **Mirrors as Choices**: The character selection screen isn't just a menu; it's a **chamber of mirrors** where the player sees reflections of themselves (the potential heroes). Picking one is like *stepping into* that reflection.
* **Escalating Stakes**: Each return to the mirror represents a deeper commitment or a forced adaptation to survive. The player starts alone, then pairs up, then forms a trio, then a full party.
* **Dreamweaver Agency**: The Dreamweavers are *active* here, not just narrators. They *insist* the player needs help, *guide* the selection process, and *react* to the combat outcomes. Their desperation grows with each failure.
* **Combat as Validation**: Each combat scenario validates the need for more allies, making the subsequent character selection feel necessary and urgent, not arbitrary.
* **Meaningful Tutorial**: Each character's first turn in battle serves as a *very brief* tutorial for their core mechanic, embedded within the narrative of "using this new ally."

### **Rough Draft Flow**

1. **Intro: The First Mirror**
    * **Narrative**: A transition from Stage 2 (e.g., a fade from the glitched escape chamber). The player finds themselves in a liminal space â€“ perhaps a room with several glowing, reflective surfaces (mirrors).
    * **Tutorial Element**: The UI presents the character selection screen (Fighter, Wizard, Thief, Scribe). The player is implicitly the "leader" but needs others.
    * **Meaningful Storytelling**: The Dreamweavers (all three might speak here, or the one most aligned from Stage 2 takes the lead) explain the need for allies. "You cannot face the echoes alone. Look into the mirrors... choose your reflection."
    * **Action**: Player selects their *first* party member (e.g., Fighter). This character becomes the initial protagonist of the first battle.

2. **Combat 1: Alone or With One**
    * **Narrative**: The player is placed in a simple, stylized battle arena (could be a visual callback to the Stage 2 dungeon or something new).
    * **Tutorial Element**: If the player controls only the first character, they take their turn (e.g., Attack). This teaches the basic combat flow for *one* character.
    * **Meaningful Storytelling**: The enemy (or enemies) are clearly too strong. The Dreamweavers react: "It's too much! You need help!" or "This path is folly without allies!"
    * **Action**: The player either takes significant damage or clearly cannot win. The battle *abruptly* ends (not necessarily lost, but interrupted by the Dreamweavers stepping in).

3. **Return to the Mirror 1: Adding a Second**
    * **Narrative**: The battle scene fades. The player is back in the mirror chamber.
    * **Tutorial Element**: UI returns to character selection, but now *two* slots are visible (one filled by the first choice). The player selects the *second* party member.
    * **Meaningful Storytelling**: "You need another echo, another strength." The Dreamweavers might comment on the first character's performance and the need for balance (e.g., "The Fighter's strength is good, but we need cunning/speed/magic").
    * **Action**: Player selects the second character (e.g., Wizard).

4. **Combat 2: Two Against the Tide**
    * **Narrative**: Return to the battle arena, now with two party members.
    * **Tutorial Element**: Player takes turns for both characters. This demonstrates controlling multiple units and introduces the *slight* complexity of strategy between two.
    * **Meaningful Storytelling**: The battle is harder (more enemies or stronger ones). The Dreamweavers: "Better, but still not enough!" or "The code fights back!"
    * **Action**: Again, the player is overwhelmed. The battle ends prematurely by Dreamweaver intervention.

5. **Return to the Mirror 2: Adding the Third & Fourth**
    * **Narrative**: Back to the mirror chamber.
    * **Tutorial Element**: UI shows three/four slots available now. The player selects the *third* and *fourth* party members in sequence or simultaneously.
    * **Meaningful Storytelling**: "Now! Quickly! We must make you whole!" or "Four echoes, four reflections â€“ this is the number Omega fears!" The urgency is palpable.
    * **Action**: Player selects the remaining two characters (e.g., Thief, Scribe).

6. **Combat 3: The Full Echo Party**
    * **Narrative**: Return to the arena with all four characters.
    * **Tutorial Element**: Player controls all four, demonstrating the full combat system. This is the "meat" of the tutorial, showing the synergy between different types. The battle should feel manageable *if* the player uses different character abilities.
    * **Meaningful Storytelling**: The tide turns. The Dreamweavers might cheer or hold their breath. "Yes! Now fight as one!"
    * **Action**: The player either wins the battle (defeating the enemy) or the battle is interrupted by Omega (similar to Stage 2's end), regardless of the outcome on screen.

7. **Conclusion: Never Go Alone**
    * **Narrative**: Fade out from combat. The mirror chamber might flicker or dissolve.
    * **Tutorial Element**: If the player *won*, show a brief victory screen. If interrupted, show the glitch/Omega message.
    * **Meaningful Storytelling**: A final line from the Dreamweavers: "You are no longer alone, Aether's Chosen. But the Spiral... it remembers." Or Omega: "Party configuration complete. Proceeding to next phase..." regardless of the battle result.
    * **Action**: Transition to Stage 4 (Amnesia Town).

### ðŸ”„ **Connection to Other Stages**

* **Stage 2 (Nethack 3 Rooms)**: The *choices* made in Stage 2 might subtly influence which character *types* feel more "natural" to select first, or which Dreamweaver is most insistent during Stage 3's selection phases, but Stage 3 itself determines the *specific* party composition for Stages 4+.
* **Stage 4 (Amnesia Town)**: The player now has a full party (or at least, the *concept* of one) to potentially interact with or reference in the town environment, even if they're initially alone. The "Never Go Alone" principle is established.

This structure keeps the **character selection as the core, meaningful choice** (the mirror reflection) and makes the **combat encounters** direct, urgent consequences that drive the narrative forward and provide the tutorial context.
