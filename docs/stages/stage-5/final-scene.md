Okay, that's a crucial and fascinating clarification! It brings the **quantum storytelling** concept full circle.

So, the flow is:

1.  **Godot-open-rpg Stage**: Standard RPG exploration.
2.  **Exit Point**: A moment arises where the player must make a **key decision**.
3.  **The Three Quantum Choices**: This single decision point branches into **three distinct scene-sequences** (or three aspects of one sequence), each aligned with a **different Dreamweaver's perspective** (e.g., Light sees it as a `FIGHT` for hope, Mischief as a `FLEE` into chaos, Wrath as a `TREASURE` hunt for power/escape).
4.  **Point Accumulation**: Throughout the demo (including this final choice), points are tallied based on choices that align with each Dreamweaver.
5.  **Alignment Matters**: While the *player* makes *one* decision (e.g., `FLEE`), the *narrative* presents *three* possible interpretations of that decision (`FIGHT`, `FLEE`, `TREASURE`), each tied to a Dreamweaver. The Dreamweaver who *agrees* with the player's *actual* choice (e.g., if the player chose `FLEE`, perhaps Wrath finds value in the strategic retreat or Mischief in the chaos of running) will have their associated scene-sequence play, or perhaps their perspective will be the most prominent *within* the chosen sequence, or their *approval* will boost their point total significantly.
6.  **Final Vantages**: Each of the three scene-sequences leads to the **same ending image** (heroes on the horizon), but the context and the *implied* dominant Dreamweaver's influence differ slightly based on the chosen path and the point tally.

This is a sophisticated way to make the player's *one* action feel like it exists within the larger, multi-faceted, quantum narrative structure, while still allowing for a branching experience and reinforcing the Dreamweavers' core identities.

**Revised Final Stage Concept:**

1.  **Godot-open-rpg Stage**: Standard RPG exploration.
2.  **Pivotal Decision Point**: A scenario arises: "A powerful echo blocks your path. What do you do?"
3.  **Presentation of Quantum Options (by the Dreamweavers)**:
    *   **Light**: "Face it head-on! Show it the power of hope!" (FIGHT)
    *   **Mischief**: "Heh, maybe we slip past? Or turn its power against itself?" (FLEE/Trick)
    *   **Wrath**: "It carries power. Take it. Use it." (TREASURE/Power)
4.  **Player Chooses**: Player picks one (e.g., `FLEE`).
5.  **Scene Sequence Launches**: The game recognizes the choice (`FLEE`) and the *context* (e.g., the environment, previous choices). It then launches the scene-sequence most aligned with that *type* of action (e.g., a sequence involving stealth, escape, or navigating uncertainty). The *narrative framing* of this sequence might heavily feature the Dreamweaver whose *philosophy* best matches the *type* of choice made (`FLEE` could be Wrath's "strategic withdrawal" or Mischief's "chaotic escape"). Simultaneously, the point system awards points: e.g., if `FLEE` aligns with Mischief's nature, Mischief gains points; if the *specific way* the player fled (e.g., by tricking the echo) aligns with Mischief's *methods*, Mischief gains *more* points; if the *outcome* of fleeing preserves the party (a Light value), Light might gain *some* points.
6.  **Within the Scene**: The scene itself plays out the *consequences* of the `FLEE` action, potentially showing the party escaping, perhaps with commentary from the *most aligned* Dreamweaver ("Heh, nicely done!"), but other Dreamweavers might still chime in ("A coward's path," "But we live to fight another day...").
7.  **Shared Finale**: Regardless of which sequence played (FIGHT, FLEE, TREASURE), the scene culminates in the heroes looking towards the horizon.
8.  **Demo End**: Over the shared finale, the game reveals the *final point tally* or the *dominant Dreamweaver* (e.g., "Wrath's influence grows..."). The "The End" message appears.

This structure maintains the **quantum** idea (three options always exist) and the **point-based** system, while creating a **meaningful final gameplay moment** in the `godot-open-rpg` stage that leads to a **branched but unified finale**. The "three vantages" are now the *three possible narrative interpretations* of the *player's single, crucial choice*, each tied to a Dreamweaver's worldview.
