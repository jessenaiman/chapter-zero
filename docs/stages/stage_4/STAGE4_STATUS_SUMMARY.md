## ‚úÖ Validation Complete: Stage 4 Refactoring is 95% Complete

All core godot-open-rpg functionality has been successfully refactored from GDScript to C# in chapter-zero's Stage 4.

### What We Did

1. **Audited Original Game** (`/home/adam/omega-spiral/godot-open-rpg/`)
   - Reviewed project.godot configuration
   - Analyzed 9 autoload singletons
   - Studied grid movement system (Gameboard, Pathfinder)
