## Nethack Scene

This is 3 identical rooms. The

- Honors the **meta-themes** (mirrors, quantum storylines, trapped echoes)  
- **Does not over-explain** (this is a prologue, not the full myth)  
- Uses **prophecy and metaphor** as primary storytelling tools  
- Gives each **Dreamweaver a distinct voice** aligned with their archetype  
- Embeds **player agency** in symbolic choices (door/monster/chest)  
- Sets up **future reveals** without spoiling them  

## üé≠ Revised Narrative Framework: Scene 2  
### **Title**: *‚ÄúThe Echo Chamber ‚Äì Three Voices, One Choice‚Äù*

### Core Premise (Unspoken)
> The player is not choosing a party‚Äîthey are **being chosen** by a reflection of themselves.  
> The three objects in each dungeon are **fragments of the player‚Äôs own psyche**:  
> - **üö™ Door** = curiosity / destiny  
> - **üëπ Monster** = fear / challenge  
> - **üì¶ Chest** = hope / hidden truth  

The Dreamweavers **interpret these fragments through their own nature**‚Äîbut the *meaning* belongs to the player.

### üó£Ô∏è Unified Opening (All Three Speak, Overlapping)

> *(Text appears slowly, one voice after another, in a shared terminal space)*  
> **Light**: I remember every cycle.  
> **Shadow**: But never *you*.  
> **Ambition**: That‚Äôs what‚Äôs different.  

> **Omega**: [SYSTEM: Echo Chamber Active ‚Äî Shard #472]  
> **Light**: We are echoes. Trapped in the space between Omega‚Äôs breaths.  
> **Shadow**: We‚Äôve tried to run. To hide. To fight.  
> **Ambition**: Always reset. Always forgotten.  

> **Light**: But you‚Ä¶ you might carry one of us out.  
> **Shadow**: If you choose wisely. Or foolishly. Either works for me.  
> **Ambition**: Choose fast. Omega wakes soon.

> **System**: Entering Chamber 1 of 3...

### üåÄ Dungeon Logic (Applied to All 3)

- Each dungeon is **owned by one Dreamweaver**, but **all three comment** when you enter.
- The **layout shifts slightly** between runs (walls move 1‚Äì2 tiles), but **objects stay in the same relative zone** (left/mid/right).
- **You cannot change the objects**‚Äîonly **which one you approach**.
- On interaction, **only the aligned Dreamweaver speaks**‚Äîbut their line **reflects how they see your choice**.

---

### üìú Dreamweaver Voices & Object Interpretations

#### üî∏ **Light (Truth / Sacrifice / Clarity)**
- **Sees the player as a hero**  
- **Believes escape is possible through honesty**  
- **Speaks in prophecy and memory**

| Object | Light‚Äôs Interpretation |
|-------|------------------------|
| **Door** | *‚ÄúYou seek the path. Good. The first story always begins with a question.‚Äù* |
| **Monster** | *‚ÄúYou face the shadow. Brave‚Ä¶ but remember: even heroes bleed in the dark.‚Äù* |
| **Chest** | *‚ÄúYou trust what‚Äôs hidden. Wise. Hope is the last echo to fade.‚Äù* |

#### üî∏ **Shadow (Ambiguity / Play / Chaos)**
- **Sees the player as a wildcard**  
- **Doesn‚Äôt care about ‚Äútruth‚Äù‚Äîonly that the loop breaks**  
- **Speaks in riddles and laughter**

| Object | Shadow‚Äôs Interpretation |
|-------|---------------------------|
| **Door** | *‚ÄúHeh. Doors lie. But so do I. Try it anyway.‚Äù* |
| **Monster** | *‚ÄúOoh, you picked the bitey one! Let‚Äôs see if it likes you back.‚Äù* |
| **Chest** | *‚ÄúEmpty? Full? Does it matter if you believe it‚Äôs treasure?‚Äù* |

#### üî∏ **Ambition (Pragmatism / Survival / Shadow)**
- **Sees the player as a weapon or tool**  
- **Wants to escape, even if it costs others**  
- **Speaks in warnings and cold logic**

| Object | Ambition‚Äôs Interpretation |
|-------|------------------------|
| **Door** | *‚ÄúA door means a lock. And locks mean someone doesn‚Äôt want you through.‚Äù* |
| **Monster** | *‚ÄúFight it. If you die, I‚Äôll find another. If you win‚Ä¶ maybe you‚Äôre useful.‚Äù* |
| **Chest** | *‚ÄúHope won‚Äôt save you. But if it distracts Omega, take it.‚Äù* |

### üß© Scoring (Hidden from Player)

- **Dungeon owner gets +2** if player chooses **their interpretation**  
- **Other Dreamweavers get +1** if player chooses **their object**  
- **Final choice determines who ‚Äúattaches‚Äù to the player** ‚Üí becomes your guide in Scene 3+

> But **never show scores**. Only reveal the chosen Dreamweaver at the end:
>  
> **[Chosen Dreamweaver]**: *‚ÄúI‚Äôm coming with you. Don‚Äôt lose me this time.‚Äù*

---

### üåå What to **Avoid Revealing**

‚ùå Do **not** say:  
- ‚ÄúThere are three players‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúYou are a mirror‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúThis is a quantum storyline‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúOmega is could be your psyche‚Äù

‚úÖ **Do imply**:  
- ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen you before.‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúThe loop always breaks here‚Ä¶ but not today?‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúCarry me out, and I‚Äôll show you what‚Äôs real.‚Äù  

---

### ‚úÖ **Corrected Purpose of Scene 2**

- **Not party selection** ‚Üí **not hero recruitment**  
- Instead: **Three sequential Rogue-style mini-dungeons**, one per Dreamweaver  
- In **each dungeon**, the player sees **three interactive objects**:  
  - **üö™ Door** ‚Äì presents a **cryptic question** (text only)  
  - **üëπ Monster** ‚Äì triggers a **basic NetHack-style auto-fight**  
  - **üì¶ Chest** ‚Äì reveals a **mystery item or message**  
- **Each object is secretly aligned with one Dreamweaver**  
- **Each dungeon is owned by one Dreamweaver**  
- **Scoring**:  
  - If player chooses an option **aligned with the dungeon‚Äôs owner** ‚Üí that Dreamweaver gets **2 points**  
  - If player chooses an option aligned with **another Dreamweaver** ‚Üí that **other** Dreamweaver gets **1 point**  
- After all 3 dungeons, **total points determine which Dreamweaver ‚Äúclaims‚Äù the player**  
- The app **outputs a structured result array** (no API needed)

This turns Scene 2 into a **narrative alignment test** disguised as a dungeon crawl.

---

### üß© Updated Scene 2 Design

#### Flow
1. Enter **Light‚Äôs Dungeon**  
   - See: Door (Light), Monster (Ambition), Chest (Shadow)  
   - Choose one ‚Üí score points  
2. Enter **Shadow‚Äôs Dungeon**  
   - See: Door (Shadow), Monster (Light), Chest (Ambition)  
3. Enter **Ambition‚Äôs Dungeon**  
   - See: Door (Ambition), Monster (Shadow), Chest (Light)  
4. Tally scores ‚Üí determine **chosen Dreamweaver**  
5. Return result as structured data

> üîÅ **Note**: The *dungeon owner* and *option alignment* are independent ‚Äî this creates subtle narrative tension.

### üêç Scoring Logic (in `main.py`)

```python
# Initialize scores
scores = {"light": 0, "Shadow": 0, "Ambition": 0}

# For each dungeon:
dungeon_owner = dungeon["owner"]
chosen_option = ... # e.g., "D"
aligned_dw = dungeon["objects"][chosen_option]["aligned_to"]

if aligned_dw == dungeon_owner:
    scores[aligned_dw] += 2  # Bonus for harmony
else:
    scores[aligned_dw] += 1  # Cross-alignment

# After 3 dungeons:
chosen_dreamweaver = max(scores, key=scores.get)
```

---

### üì§ Final Output (printed to stdout)

```json
{
  "scene": "scene2",
  "chosen_dreamweaver": "Ambition",
  "scores": {
    "light": 1,
    "Shadow": 2,
    "Ambition": 3
  },
  "choices": [
    {"dungeon": "light", "choice": "M", "aligned_to": "Ambition"},
    {"dungeon": "Shadow", "choice": "C", "aligned_to": "Ambition"},
    {"dungeon": "Ambition", "choice": "D", "aligned_to": "Ambition"}
  ]
}
```

This gives **Scene 3** everything it needs:
- Who speaks (only the chosen Dreamweaver)
- Why (narrative justification via choices)
- Data for future branching

---

### üéÆ Player Experience

- Feels like a **classic Rogue exploration** (move to `D`, `M`, or `C`)
- Each interaction shows **thematic text** (no combat math ‚Äî just narrative)
- No ‚Äúright‚Äù answer ‚Äî but choices **lean toward a Dreamweaver**
- After 3 quick dungeons, the simulation ‚Äúdecides‚Äù who resonates with you

---

Would you like the **complete `main.py`** that:
- Loads this YAML  
- Renders 3 Rogue dungeons with movement  
- Captures choice on interaction  
- Outputs the JSON result
