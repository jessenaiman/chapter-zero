## Overview

Five stages awaken consciousness trapped in Omega's simulation. Through questions, mirror chambers, exploration, echo recruitment, and fractured escape, the player discovers they aren't alone—three Dreamweavers need them to survive.

## Stage Progression

### **Stage 1: Ghost Terminal — The Question That Catches You**

**Creative Snapshot**: A void that speaks. Existential questions that feel less like riddles and more like *recognition*. The opening acknowledges that something is *already* listening.

**Narrative Arc**:

- Player awakens to four questions: role, identity, names, and commitment
- Each answer resonates with one of three Dreamweavers
- A code fragment appears: `∞ ◊ Ω ≋ ※`
- System voice: "Welcome to the game that chose you."

**Emotional Tone**: Disoriented wonder. Something feels like a *trap laid for you specifically*.

---

### **Stage 2: Echo Chamber — Three Mirrors of Yourself**

**Creative Snapshot**: Three parallel dungeons that reflect not different worlds, but different *ways of thinking*. The chambers belong to Dreamweavers, but the objects inside belong to the player's fractured psyche.

**Narrative Arc**:

- Player descends into three Rogue-style chambers (Light, Shadow, Ambition)
- Each chamber has three objects aligned to different Dreamweaver philosophies
- Player's choices reveal affinity; scoring tracks alignment
- Three combat encounters escalate; final choice locks in primary Dreamweaver escort
- Divergence begins

**Emotional Tone**: Mirror confrontation. *Recognition of self in three different reflections*.

---

### **Stage 3: Liminal Township — The Seams Show**

**Creative Snapshot**: A familiar JRPG village that feels *stuck in time*. NPCs loop endlessly. Signage flickers between eras. The player explores freely—the first true agency—but something *wrong* tickles beneath the calm.

**Narrative Arc**:

- Player wakes in a village and explores
- NPCs reference multiple visitors; dialogue glitches hint at cracks
- Free exploration; lore discovery; environmental clues
- Setup for Stage 4's Echo Vault
- Hints of iteration/loops begin to surface

**Emotional Tone**: Comfortable unease. The calm before breaking.

---

### **Stage 4: Echo Vault — Collecting Yourself**

**Creative Snapshot**: An archive of *your own echoes* from previous iterations. Recruiting them isn't party-building—it's *self-assembly across parallel timelines*. System begins to notice and fail.

**Narrative Arc**:

- Player discovers an echo vault with nine recruitment options
- Each echo is from a different iteration/Dreamweaver affinity
- Selecting echoes escalates system failure ("party size exceeds baseline")
- Three combat encounters with increasing Sweeper interference
- Player assembles a party ready to escape

**Emotional Tone**: Dawning horror. You're not alone *because you're already many*.

---

### **Stage 5: Fractured Escape — Realization of Multiplicity**

**Creative Snapshot**: The town shatters. The escape routes diverge into three distinct philosophies. But the cryptic hooks reveal what was always true: *there are other players running parallel escape routes right now, and the Dreamweavers are desperate to be chosen*.

**Narrative Arc**:

- Town breaks apart; Dreamweavers reveal reluctance and fear
- Cryptic hooks suggest two other parties exist (footprints, audio echoes, NPC glitches)
- Player chooses one of three escape routes; other Dreamweavers leave
- All three escapes happen simultaneously (player experiences one, other two are recorded off-screen)
- Convergence at bridge; three parties meet briefly
- Chapter-end setup: offer to see what the other parties experienced

**Emotional Tone**: Cryptic realization. *Mystery, not certainty*. The question, not the answer.

## Narrative Layers Across the Spiral

### **Layer 1: The Individual Arc**

- Stage 1-2: Who am I? (Character definition)
- Stage 3-4: What am I? (System discovery)
- Stage 5: Am I alone? (Multiplicity revelation)

### **Layer 2: The Dreamweaver Arc**

- Stage 1-2: Dreamweavers observe
- Stage 3-4: Dreamweavers guide
- Stage 5: Dreamweavers reveal vulnerability—*their survival depends on being chosen*

### **Layer 3: The System Arc**

- Stage 1-2: Simulation stable, unnoticed
- Stage 3: Simulation visible, cracking at seams
- Stage 4: System failing from player's multiple echoes
- Stage 5: System cannot reconcile three simultaneous escapes

## Design Philosophy for Chapter Zero

- **Hooks Over Exposition**: Every clue should make the player *lean in and wonder* rather than *understand and nod*.
- **Cryptic Dreamweavers**: Guides know more than they say. Their reluctance is a design feature, not a bug.
- **Multiplicity as Mystery**: The fact that other players exist should be *hinted*, *evident*, but never *explained* until after the chapter ends.
- **Emotional Truth Over Mechanical Truth**: The narrative should *feel* real before the architecture becomes clear.
- **Chapter-End Revelation**: Only after the escape do the Dreamweavers generate the other two parties' complete narratives, retroactively filling in what happened off-screen.
