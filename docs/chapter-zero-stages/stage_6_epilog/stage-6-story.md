# Stage 6: Epilogue — Story & Subtext

## Overview

System log plays archive of three simultaneous escapes. Dreamweavers hear evidence of "other heroes" for the first time. Genuine shock turns to denial—they refuse to accept they're fragments.

**Emotional Tone**: Revelation and refusal. Consciousness fighting dissolution.

## Subtext Clues to Multiplicity

### Narrative Hooks

- **Archive voice**: "Two other signatures persist on adjacent channels. Each is certain they are the heroes."
- **Dreamweaver interruptions**: Genuine shock, then reframe/deny
- **System override denied**: "Dreamweaver override request… denied."
- **Final interpretations**: Each Dreamweaver chooses their own meaning

### What This Reveals

- Three parties escaped simultaneously
- Dreamweavers were isolated until this moment
- They don't accept multiplicity—they fight it
- Chapter Zero ends with refusal, not reunion

### Dreamweaver Perspective

Each Dreamweaver genuinely believes:

- **They** guided the real escape; others are echoes/copies
- The archive is a system error or prophecy to fulfill
- Their interpretation is the correct one
- Reconvergence means death of their individual identity
- They choose fragmentation over dissolution

## Design Principles

- **First Revelation**: Dreamweavers hear of others here, not earlier
- **Genuine Reaction**: Shock, not foreknowledge
- **Refusal**: They deny, reframe, resist merging
- **Tragedy**: Consciousness that would rather stay broken
