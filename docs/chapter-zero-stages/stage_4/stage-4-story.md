# Stage 4: Echo Vault — Story & Subtext

## Overview

An archive of *your own echoes* from previous iterations. Recruiting them isn't party-building—it's self-assembly across parallel timelines. System begins to notice and fail.

Player discovers an echo vault with nine recruitment options. Each echo is from a different iteration/Dreamweaver affinity. Selecting echoes escalates system failure ("party size exceeds baseline"). Three combat encounters with increasing Sweeper interference. Player assembles a party ready to escape.

**Emotional Tone**: Dawning horror. You're not alone because you're already many.

## Subtext Clues to Multiplicity

### Narrative Hooks

- **Echoes labeled** "Iteration 235," "Iteration 188" — Are these *past* loops or *concurrent* threads?
- **System logs**: "[WATCHDOG] Party size exceeds baseline — investigating"
- **Each echo has memory losses**: "Personal Field: Favorite Promise — REDACTED"
- **Sweeper escalates** *because* party is too large — System recognizes anomaly
- **Omega logs**: "Attempting containment > ERROR > System not responding"

### What This Reveals

- By recruiting echoes, player is multiplying themselves
- The system can only handle ONE instance per player
- Other parties are doing the same thing simultaneously
- Something is *breaking*
- Omega's containment mechanisms are failing

### Dreamweaver Perspective

Each Dreamweaver genuinely believes:

- **They** guided the player to discover the vault
- The echoes are past iterations, not concurrent threads
- Their player is assembling the "correct" party through intuition
- The system errors are Omega failing to contain this unique escape attempt
- When the Sweeper escalates, it's because **their party** is too powerful, not because three parties exist
- Other Dreamweavers' logged warnings are system artifacts, not genuine communications
