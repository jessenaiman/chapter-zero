# Stage 2: Echo Chamber — Story & Subtext

## Overview

Three parallel dungeons that reflect not different worlds, but different ways of thinking. The chambers belong to Dreamweavers, but the objects inside belong to the player's fractured psyche.

Player descends into three Rogue-style chambers (Light, Shadow, Ambition). Each chamber has three objects aligned to different Dreamweaver philosophies. Player's choices reveal affinity; scoring tracks alignment. Three combat encounters escalate; final choice locks in primary Dreamweaver escort. Divergence begins.

**Emotional Tone**: Mirror confrontation. Recognition of self in three different reflections.

## Subtext Clues to Multiplicity

### Narrative Hooks

- **Three chambers exist simultaneously** — Are they running at once?
- **Objects are mirrors** — Aligned to *three* different philosophies
- **Scoring ledger tracks all three paths** — We only see one
- **NPC dialogue**: "Echoes memorize what we forget" — *Whose echoes?*
- **Final scene**: Three Dreamweavers lock eyes; one fades with player

### What This Reveals

- We're making three choices, not one
- Each Dreamweaver is bound to one path, but watches the others
- Someone is *keeping score* of all three
- Multiplicity is structural, not accidental

### Dreamweaver Perspective

Each Dreamweaver genuinely believes:

- **They** guided the player through the chamber aligned to their philosophy
- The player's object choices prove their connection
- The other chambers are potential paths the player rejected
- Their affinity score is THE real metric of compatibility
- When they "lock eyes" with the others, they interpret it as system echoes, not equal consciousnesses
