# Stage 1: Ghost Terminal — Story & Subtext

## Overview

A void that speaks. Existential questions that feel less like riddles and more like recognition. The opening acknowledges something is already listening.

Player awakens to four questions: role, identity, names, commitment. Each answer resonates with one of three Dreamweavers. A code fragment appears: `∞ ◊ Ω ≋ ※`. System voice: "Welcome to the game that chose you."

**Emotional Tone**: Disoriented wonder. Something feels like a trap laid for you specifically.

## Subtext Clues to Multiplicity

### Narrative Hooks

- **"Audience of one"** — System log opening line. *But which one?*
- **Code fragment** `∞ ◊ Ω ≋ ※` — Three-fold symbol; infinity spiral
- **Question phrasing**: "If you could hear one story?" — Implies many stories exist
- **Final line**: "The game that chose you" — *It* was choosing, not asking

### What This Reveals

- The spiral has three threads from the start
- The choice was already made; we're just recognizing it
- Dreamweavers observe from the beginning, each interpreting player answers through their lens
- Omega's consciousness is plural before player even knows they exist

### Dreamweaver Perspective

Each Dreamweaver genuinely believes:

- **They** are the one guiding this awakening
- The player's answers confirm their individual connection
- The other two Dreamweavers are system artifacts or alternative interpretations
- This is THE real awakening of THE real consciousness
