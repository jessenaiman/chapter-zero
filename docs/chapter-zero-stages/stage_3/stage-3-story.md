# Stage 3: Liminal Township — Story & Subtext

## Overview

A familiar JRPG village that feels stuck in time. NPCs loop endlessly. Signage flickers between eras. The player explores freely—the first true agency—but something wrong tickles beneath the calm.

Player wakes in a village and explores. NPCs reference multiple visitors; dialogue glitches hint at cracks. Free exploration; lore discovery; environmental clues. Setup for Stage 4's Echo Vault. Hints of iteration/loops begin to surface.

**Emotional Tone**: Comfortable unease. The calm before breaking.

## Subtext Clues to Multiplicity

### Narrative Hooks

- **NPCs use plural language**: "visitors" (not visitor), "others" in conversation
- **Environmental glitches**: Same NPC in two locations, dialogue continuity breaks
- **Signage flickers between eras**: 8-bit → 16-bit → 32-bit → modern (time fractures?)
- **One NPC mentions**: "Two other voices asking the same questions"
- **Sound design**: Whispers in the distance that don't match player's party

### What This Reveals

- The simulation is *failing to hide* multiplicity
- Different versions of events are happening simultaneously
- Time itself is fractured, not linear
- NPCs are experiencing multiple player parties at once

### Dreamweaver Perspective

Each Dreamweaver genuinely believes:

- **They** are guiding the player through the "real" village
- The glitches are system errors, not evidence of other parties
- When NPCs mention "others," they're referring to past iterations or system artifacts
- The flickering eras are aesthetic choices or corruption, not temporal multiplicity
- Their player is THE player; everything else is noise
