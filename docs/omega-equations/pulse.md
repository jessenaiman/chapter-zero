# ψ (Psi)

### Overview
In **Ωmega Spiral**, ψ represents **PULSE (ψ)**, capturing the frequency of critical health moments to heighten combat tension.

### General Definitions and Uses

The Greek letter **ψ (psi)** is prominent in quantum mechanics and mathematics.

- **Physics**: ψ denotes the wave function in quantum mechanics, describing a system’s probabilistic state.
- **Mathematics**: ψ is the digamma function, related to the gamma function.
- **Fluid Dynamics**: ψ represents the stream function in flow analysis.

### Application in Ωmega Spiral
In the game, ψ is defined as **PULSE (ψ)**, measuring **critical health frequency**:
\[ \psi = \frac{\text{turns below 20\% HP}}{\text{total turns}} \]
- **Turns below 20% HP**: Number of turns where the player’s health drops below 20% of maximum.
- **Total turns**: Total number of turns in the combat session.

The sweet spot is 10–20%, balancing risk and survivability.

### Connection to General Use
In quantum mechanics, ψ describes the probability of a particle’s state, akin to how PULSE (ψ) in **Ωmega Spiral** reflects the likelihood of being in a critical health state, creating tension akin to *Dark Souls*.

### Example
If a player spends 3 turns out of 15 below 20% HP:
\[ \psi = \frac{3}{15} = 0.2 \text{ or } 20\% \]
This is at the upper end of the ideal range (10–20%), indicating appropriately tense combat.

### Importance in Game Design
PULSE (ψ) introduces high-stakes moments without making combat overly punishing. It enhances the survival narrative of **Ωmega Spiral**, where nanobots push players to the brink.
