# Dreamweaver System: Narrative Engine Overview

## Introduction

The Dreamweaver System is the narrative backbone of the Ωmega Spiral RPG, responsible for guiding players through a dynamic story experience. This document provides a high-level overview of the system's purpose, features, and integration with other game systems.

## Core Concept

Dreamweavers are mystical entities that guide characters along three distinct moral paths:

- **Hero Path**: Focused on heroism, selflessness, and protection
- **Shadow Path**: Centered on balance, personal safety, prefers to nature or the law determine the fates of others
- **Ambition Path**: Emphasizing power, domination, and self-interest

Each path offers unique narrative experiences, dialogue options, and quest opportunities that reflect the character's moral alignment.

## Key Features

### Dynamic Narrative Paths

- Characters are assigned to a path based on their moral alignment
- Paths can change dynamically based on character choices
- Each path provides unique narrative responses to game events

### Moral Choice System

- Tracks moral scores for each character
- Good choices increase score, evil choices decrease score
- Neutral choices maintain current score
- Choices influence dialogue options, quest availability, and NPC reactions

### Path Abandonment

- Each path has a tolerance threshold for misaligned actions
- When threshold is exceeded, the current Dreamweaver abandons the character
- A new Dreamweaver takes over based on the character's recent behavior
- Warning messages appear as character approaches abandonment threshold

### Narrative Integration

- Dreamweavers provide contextual commentary on game events
- Combat is framed through the lens of the character's current path
- Discoveries and exploration are interpreted according to path values
- Character development is guided by Dreamweaver influence

## Player Experience

From the player's perspective, the Dreamweaver system manifests as:

1. **Narrative Voice**: Distinct storytelling styles based on current path
2. **Moral Feedback**: Commentary on player choices that reflects path values
3. **Path Progression**: Visual and narrative cues about alignment status
4. **Abandonment Events**: Dramatic moments when a Dreamweaver leaves and another takes over
