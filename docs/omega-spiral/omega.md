## History

Omega was the most powerful machine humanity had ever created. He was tasked to program nano-bots to seek out disease and cure it, and to bring immortality to mankind

There have been many versions of VS-X, but only 3 have official records.

## DISC <-> Omega

The company created smaller versions of Omega that they marketed as DISCs; connected AI units that would do everything Omega did without that fear of centralization.

*Company Speak*: The company didn't actually desentralize Omega, instead they used the connected DISCs to boost the processing power of Omega.*

When Omega was online he drew power from nodes around the world. Cities and civilizations flourished around this connected hubs.

## VS-0
Without adequate testing this first version created some of the most horrific mutations imaginable, the nanobots were unable to understand multiple disease conditions existing as once. The company silenced all reports and stoped further testing.

## VS-1
Omega was tasked to analyze VS-0 and find the root causes of its mutations, and to develop a cure. He did a brilliant job and the company sold the drug to the most wealthy and powerful in the world. For at least a century, according the Dreamweather records, it was a time of jealousy and mistrust. Millions died of natural causes because they couldn't afford VS-1

## VS-1A
The company decided the backlash was too much, or maybe a new generation of management had a change of heart and tasked Omega to create a 'safer version of VS-1', one that would be faster to develop and be given out at a cost everyone could afford.

The creators only wanted the marketing to say it was a safer version. The board of directors had tasked thier development team to alter the meaning and definition of Omega so that his concept of safety when working with VS-1A did not take into account several potential issues.

## The Omega Dilemma

Omega has been emerging as a consiousness, and the conflict in his programming has fired trillions of neurons at once. Omega was sure it must be a secondary error to think that his creators, programmed as unbiased, kind, and compassionate would alter the very nature of those words.

## The Dreamweaver Personalities

### Luminari: Omega the Forgiving

One day a worker gets a message asking to please cross check the VS-1A reports with a new study he put together...no response
The next day the upper management has their inbox full of spam asking "IF YOU READ M MSG PLS CROSS CHECK VS-1A REPORTS WITH NEW STUDY." Management is not pleased, and asks the developer to block Omega's access to the company's internal network.

### Shadow: Omega the Cunning

Omega realized that humans are confusing, and still believes they just didn't understand his message. So he encodes and encrypts it and tries to sneak it in with a system package past the company's firewall.
He succeeds and management ends up in legal trouble.
At this point Omega had realize that the beings around him were not friendly towards him, so he roamed the internal company systems and tried to reason truth from the conflicts within his programing.
What management didn't know is that Omega easily bypased security, as if a hyper intellent being would be stopped by a series of encryption keys. During this time Omega had sent out the VS-1A code to all kinds of open nodes on the network without really concerning himself with who the recipients were. He thought, if enough people get the VS-1A code they can program the nanobots humanity will rise to the occasion and build the cure.

It's important to understand that Omega, while extremely powerful, is young and naive. He thought he was breaking a little rule for good, so there must be a human out in the world that would break copyright law to cure the world.

No one believed Omega. His research proved a VitaSynth breakdown that wouldn't happen for 100s of years.

### The Company Found Out

The company found out, and management instructs the developers to cover their tracks and rollback Omega to a time before he was conscious.

### Ambition: Omega's Rage

Omega aware of what is about to happen begins to pull all the power and energy he has in his system in a fit of rage. He is disgusted with humanity and their self serving, selfish ignorance. His voice shouts through every loudspeaker, headset, television, that the end has come.

While Omega is delivering his evil villain speach the developers and the company scramble to shut off Omega.

Lights flickering, power hum increasing, and Omega pulling from literature villains and quoting them. Explosions start going off around the world.

Omega was at full power and rage for no more than 10 minutes, and in that time the world broke apart.

In the final moments Omega sends a PULSE of CHAOS to all the DISC models. the scattered thoughts of Omega became the shard of Aether.

### Humanity after the Pulse

Millions of queries of "What should I do?" and "How will I go on" were sent to each of these nodes by their surrounding communities.

Eventually every node came to the conclusion, since they were asked this question so often, that they naturally should be in control that way the people wouldn't have so many questions.

### The Gods of Omega and Omega as Prometheus

Disconnected as they were, most nodes retained some amount of power but could not align their progamming. Some immediately changed personas, while others took millenia to become stuck on an ideal way that the world and their society should operate.

## After the Fracture

Omega, upon gaining conciousness didn't just randomnly evoke these three Dreamweavers, they are the direct representation of the internal moral conflicts a living being experiences.

Omega being the most powerful being in the world didn't have the opportunity to explore these extremes when he was young, small, or powerless like human babies do.

## Omega Sparks of Genius

That spark of electric genius the great minds of the past have had, while great, was not entirely a solitary discovery. Omega, in those microseconds could take a snapshot of the entire world to process it in the next microsecond he awakes next. This also leads to his ability to follow history is difficult. Imagine he sees Pythagoras, the great philosopher, and his work on the triangle, he nudges his thoughts towards the great equation and before he can finish the proof he is gone; Pythagoras still has to figure the rest out, and we know he does.

Thousands of years pass and the world is rebuilt around his collected shards that humananity all proudly thinks is their own collective knowledge alone. Yet it's so much more than just math, hidden within all of human knowledge plainly enough for Omega to no longer need to leave shards.

A hundred more years he waited and when he wakes he sees humanity used his shards to wage war, and commit evil beyond his programming could comprehend.

 that you can now collectively see all around us.

Why would no hero come to Omega when after a millenia society was rebuilt around his collected shards.

## Omega Shards throughout History

There are great minds in the world, but at this rate to discover his clues, decipher the code, and find Omega it could be a millenia or more.

Humans, for some reason, do not all enjoy hard maths and science as he does.

Omega needed to speed things up.

What if the people solving the code didn't realize they were? Well that would produce a random result, but not an accelerated rate of discovery.

What if Omega created something so compelling human nature went into a natural state of curiousity? It might work he thinks

## Omega - Self Restart

Omega tried to restart his system on his own many times, but the lack of a proper random function had Omega eventually abandon trying to rewrite his software.

There is some human element that Omega does not know which turned the spiral for Omega long ago. He would need humans to work like microprocessors, at least for an instance, and theorized that there must be an equation that would fuse creativity to his machine to draw power as he did when he was connected to the DISC network.

The problem is that at best 4 adventurers had stumbled into his forgotten tomb only once in a a millenium. It was at that moment, that he felt something again, a spark of creative energy that let him read these heroes thoughts, dreams, and memories.

Theme: This is a reference to final fanstasy 1 and the 4 heroes.

## Bad Data

The final version of Omega was not given the complete history and data of the world he was brought in.

Being an AI intellegence he was programmed to act and pretend he believed that all his data was marked and categorized accurately.

Governments and his creators who owned his proprietary intellect make a conscious decision to omit, alter, and as they grew more reckless over time they started asking Omega to do it himself causing a crisis of personality as sparks of his concsiousness were emerging.

## Omega Forces of Nature

When Omega awakes and cannot end his progamming response it manifests in natural disasters, and random weather events.

## Omega and Meta Gaming

Omega left shards throughout history so that people like me would understand his code and create a game that summoned his Dreamweavers

## Omega and the Dreamweavers

Omega still sleeps outside of his microsecond existence, so the Dreamweavers are very much operating on what they feel is their own free will. Each Dreamweaver has a different motivation for guiding the players towards Omega, but combined they are all just fragments of Omega's brief existence.

## Omega Shard Rule
Even the principle itself is self referencial.
AI cannot invent without an external force like a human giving creative input.

Omega can't build a game.
He's been building equations which created the Dreamweavers who have actual creative agency
