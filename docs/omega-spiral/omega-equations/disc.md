# DISC (δ) Overview

The Greek letter **δ (delta)** is a versatile symbol commonly used to represent change or difference. In **Ωmega Spiral**, δ quantifies **tactical adaptability**, a key metric for assessing how dynamically players adjust their strategies during combat.

### General Definitions and Uses
- **Mathematics**: δ denotes a small change or difference in a variable, such as δx in calculus.
- **Physics**: The Dirac delta function represents a point impulse or distribution.
- **Chemistry**: δ indicates partial charges (e.g., δ+ for slightly positive).
- **Statistics**: δ can signify an error term or the difference between observed and expected values.

### Application in Ωmega Spiral
In the game, δ is defined as **DISC (δ)**, measuring **tactical adaptability** as a percentage:
\[ \delta = \left( \frac{\text{decision shifts}}{\text{total turns}} \right) \times 100 \]
- **Decision shifts**: The number of times a player changes their strategy or action type (e.g., from attacking to defending).
- **Total turns**: The total number of turns in a combat session.

The "sweet spot" for δ is 10–20%, indicating an optimal level of adaptability that keeps combat engaging without overwhelming the player.

### Connection to General Use
In its general mathematical sense, δ represents change, which aligns with its role in **Ωmega Spiral** as a measure of how often players alter their tactics. A higher δ reflects greater adaptability, mirroring the game’s theme of constant evolution driven by VitaSynth nanobots.

### Example
Suppose a player changes their strategy 5 times over 20 turns:
\[ \delta = \left( \frac{5}{20} \right) \times 100 = 25\% \]
This value exceeds the ideal range (10–20%), suggesting the combat might feel too erratic, potentially requiring design adjustments like fewer forced decision points.

### Importance in Game Design
DISC (δ) ensures combat encourages tactical flexibility without becoming chaotic. It ties directly into the nanotech narrative, where adaptability is a survival trait, and helps designers tune encounter variety.
