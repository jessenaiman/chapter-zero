# C# Documentation Rules

**MUST ENFORCE XML Documentation Comments**

- Public members should be documented with XML comments.
- It is encouraged to document internal members as well, especially if they are complex or not self-explanatory.
- Use `<summary>` for method descriptions. This should be a brief overview of what the method does.
- Use `<param>` for method parameters.
- Use `<paramref>` to reference parameters in documentation.
- Use `<returns>` for method return values.
- Use `<remarks>` for additional information, which can include implementation details, usage notes, or any other relevant context.
- Use `<example>` for usage examples on how to use the member.
- Use `<exception>` to document exceptions thrown by methods.
- Use `<see langword>` for language-specific keywords like `null`, `true`, `false`, `int`, `bool`, etc.
- Use `<see cref>` to reference other types or members inline (in a sentence).
- Use `<seealso>` for standalone (not in a sentence) references to other types or members in the "See also" section of the online docs.
- Use `<inheritdoc/>` to inherit documentation from base classes or interfaces.
  - Unless there is major behavior change, in which case you should document the differences.
- Use `<typeparam>` for type parameters in generic types or methods.
- Use `<typeparamref>` to reference type parameters in documentation.
- Use `<c>` for inline code snippets.
- Use `<code>` for code blocks. `<code>` tags should be placed within an `<example>` tag. Add the language of the code example using the `language` attribute, for example, `<code language="csharp">`.

# C# Async Programming Best Practices

Your goal is to help me follow best practices for asynchronous programming in C#.

## Naming Conventions

- Use the 'Async' suffix for all async methods
- Match method names with their synchronous counterparts when applicable (e.g., `GetDataAsync()` for `GetData()`)

## Return Types

- Return `Task<T>` when the method returns a value
- Return `Task` when the method doesn't return a value
- Consider `ValueTask<T>` for high-performance scenarios to reduce allocations
- Avoid returning `void` for async methods except for event handlers

## Exception Handling

- Use try/catch blocks around await expressions
- Avoid swallowing exceptions in async methods
- Use `ConfigureAwait(false)` when appropriate to prevent deadlocks in library code
- Propagate exceptions with `Task.FromException()` instead of throwing in async Task returning methods

## Performance

- Use `Task.WhenAll()` for parallel execution of multiple tasks
- Use `Task.WhenAny()` for implementing timeouts or taking the first completed task
- Avoid unnecessary async/await when simply passing through task results
- Consider cancellation tokens for long-running operations

## Common Pitfalls

- Never use `.Wait()`, `.Result`, or `.GetAwaiter().GetResult()` in async code
- Avoid mixing blocking and async code
- Don't create async void methods (except for event handlers)
- Always await Task-returning methods

## Implementation Patterns

- Implement the async command pattern for long-running operations
- Use async streams (IAsyncEnumerable<T>) for processing sequences asynchronously
- Consider the task-based asynchronous pattern (TAP) for public APIs
