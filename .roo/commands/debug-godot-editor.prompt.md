All problems issues are critical.

## Tasks
1. Run `godot --editor --debug` and immediately check the terminal and read the entire output:
- create a todo list of all problems found.
- warning are also problems.
2. Use the godot mcp tool to valid that the game loads
- use the godot mcp tools or the terminal to check for any issues. Respond in chat immediately with any build issues found. Explain what you found in concise single sentence bullet points with clear categories
3. Fix everything. That means the game runs, there are no warnings, and all problems are resolved.
4. After fixing, run `godot --editor --debug` again and verify that all problems are resolved.
5. Before responding with your final answer run tests to ensure your assumptions about the fixes are correct.


## Rules

**DO NOT MODIFY CONFIGURATION FILES**

- you may suggest changes to configuration files, but you must not modify them directly.
