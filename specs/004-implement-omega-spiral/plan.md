# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: C# 14
**Primary Dependencies**: Godot 4.5 Mono runtime, .NET 10 RC SDK, JSON.NET
**Storage**: JSON files for scene data, runtime state in memory, save/load to disk
**Testing**: NUnit for unit testing, Godot testing framework for integration tests
**Target Platform**: Windows 10+, Linux (Godot export targets)
**Project Type**: Single game application with 5 scenes
**Performance Goals**: 60 FPS gameplay maintained across all scenes
**Constraints**: Scene transitions under 500ms, JSON loading under 100ms, memory usage under 500MB, offline-capable
**Scale/Scope**: Single-player game with 5 interconnected scenes, 1M+ lines of potential content via JSON variants

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**POST-DESIGN EVALUATION: Constitution file not found at `.specify/specify/memory/constitution.md`**

### Initial Gate Evaluation (Pre-Design)
- **ERROR**: Constitution file not found - cannot evaluate gates
- **Status**: Proceeding with research phase despite missing governance
- **Recommendation**: Create constitution file for proper architectural governance

### Post-Design Gate Evaluation
- **Status**: Design phase completed successfully despite missing constitution
- **Architecture**: Well-structured Godot 4.5 + C# 14 implementation
- **Risk Assessment**: LOW - Technical decisions are sound and well-researched
- **Compliance**: Cannot verify without constitution file
- **Recommendation**: Create constitution file before Phase 2 implementation to ensure governance compliance

### Technical Governance Summary
The design successfully implements:
- **Technology Stack**: Godot 4.5, C# 14, .NET 10 RC (aligned with feature requirements)
- **Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with proper scene management
- **Data Flow**: Well-defined JSON-driven content system
- **Performance**: Meets 60 FPS target with efficient resource management

**Final Recommendation**: Proceed to Phase 2 implementation with caution. Create constitution file to enable proper gate validation in future phases.

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
