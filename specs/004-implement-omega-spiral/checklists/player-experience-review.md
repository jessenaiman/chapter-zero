# Player Experience & Flow Requirements Review Checklist

**Purpose**: Validate player experience requirements for progression, state persistence, and UX flows (CRITICAL GATE)
**Created**: 2025-10-11
**Feature**: specs/004-implement-omega-spiral/spec.md
**Focus**: Lightweight review ensuring no progression blocking, state corruption, or UX flow issues

## Player Progression Requirements

- [ ] CHK300 Are all player progression checkpoints clearly defined without soft-lock possibilities? [Coverage, Spec §User Stories]
- [ ] CHK301 Is the Dreamweaver alignment scoring system completely specified with clear win conditions? [Completeness, Spec §User Story 2]
- [ ] CHK302 Are scene transition requirements defined to prevent progression blocking? [Critical, Spec §Runtime Flow]
- [ ] CHK303 Is the party creation validation specified to ensure 3-member requirement? [Completeness, Spec §User Story 3]
- [ ] CHK304 Are combat win/loss conditions clearly specified with proper exits? [Completeness, Spec §User Story 5]

## State Persistence & Data Integrity Requirements

- [ ] CHK305 Are automatic save points clearly defined at scene boundaries? [Clarity, Spec §Clarifications]
- [ ] CHK306 Is GameState persistence explicitly specified to prevent data loss? [Critical, Spec §Global State]
- [ ] CHK307 Are save file corruption recovery requirements defined? [Coverage, Gap]
- [ ] CHK308 Is cross-scene state validation specified to catch corruption early? [Coverage, Gap]
- [ ] CHK309 Are player choices properly persisted in requirements (name, thread, party)? [Completeness, Spec §User Stories]

## Interactive Object & Choice Requirements

- [ ] CHK310 Are all interactive objects (door/monster/chest) clearly specified per dungeon? [Completeness, Spec §User Story 2]
- [ ] CHK311 Is player choice feedback immediately visible (alignment scores, dialogue)? [Clarity, Spec §User Story 2]
- [ ] CHK312 Are choice consequences traceable through subsequent scenes? [Traceability, Spec §User Story 6]
- [ ] CHK313 Is input validation specified to prevent invalid player actions? [Coverage, Gap]

## UI/UX Flow Requirements

- [ ] CHK314 Are keyboard navigation requirements complete for all interactive elements? [Completeness, Spec §Input Handling]
- [ ] CHK315 Is typewriter effect timing specified for narrative readability? [Measurability, Spec §User Story 1]
- [ ] CHK316 Are loading states defined for async operations (JSON loading, scene transitions)? [Coverage, Gap]
- [ ] CHK317 Is error messaging specified for player-facing issues? [Clarity, Gap]
- [ ] CHK318 Are UI panel requirements (inventory/map/stats) clearly defined? [Completeness, Spec §User Story 4]

## Edge Cases & Recovery Requirements

- [ ] CHK319 Are zero-state scenarios addressed (no saves, empty inventory)? [Coverage, Edge Case]
- [ ] CHK320 Is "stuck player" recovery mechanism specified? [Coverage, Gap]
- [ ] CHK321 Are invalid JSON data handling requirements defined for player experience? [Coverage, Spec §Error Handling]
- [ ] CHK322 Is game restart/resume functionality clearly specified? [Completeness, Spec §User Story 6]

## Notes

This is a CRITICAL GATE checklist. Any incomplete items related to progression blocking, state corruption, or broken UX flows should block implementation. Focus on ensuring players can complete the game without encountering unrecoverable states.
