## Notes

This checklist validates technical requirements quality for the Ωmega Spiral Godot 4.5 + C# 14 implementation. Focus is on requirement clarity, completeness, and implementation-readiness rather than testing the actual game functionality.

Key areas that need attention based on the spec review:
- Many Godot-specific technical requirements are missing from the current specification
- Performance requirements need to be more specific to each scene type
- Asset management and pipeline requirements are largely undefined
- Error handling and debugging requirements need specification
- Platform-specific export and compatibility requirements need documentation
- Testing and QA requirements need more specific definition for the Godot context
