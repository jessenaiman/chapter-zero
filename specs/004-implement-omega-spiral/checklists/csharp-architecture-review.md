# C# Architecture & Code Quality Review Checklist

**Purpose**: Validate C# 14 architecture requirements with emphasis on DRY principles and maintainability
**Created**: 2025-10-11
**Feature**: specs/004-implement-omega-spiral/spec.md
**Focus**: Lightweight review for iterative development, prioritizing code reuse and clean patterns

## DRY & Code Reuse Requirements

- [ ] CHK400 Are shared data models (DreamweaverChoice, DungeonObject) specified once and reused? [DRY, Spec §Data Model]
- [ ] CHK401 Is GameState singleton properly specified to avoid duplicate state management? [DRY, Spec §Project Architecture]
- [ ] CHK402 Are common JSON loading patterns abstracted to reusable utilities? [DRY, Gap]
- [ ] CHK403 Is scene transition logic centralized in SceneManager requirements? [DRY, Spec §Runtime Flow]
- [ ] CHK404 Are UI component requirements defined for reuse across multiple scenes? [DRY, Gap]

## Async & Performance Patterns Requirements

- [ ] CHK405 Are async/await patterns specified for I/O operations (JSON loading, file access)? [Completeness, Spec §Performance]
- [ ] CHK406 Is main thread blocking prevention explicitly required for async operations? [Clarity, Spec §Performance]
- [ ] CHK407 Are Task-based patterns specified over blocking calls? [Consistency, Gap]

## Data Model & Serialization Requirements

- [ ] CHK408 Are C# data models aligned with JSON schema contracts? [Consistency, Spec §Data Model]
- [ ] CHK409 Is JSON.NET serialization/deserialization pattern clearly specified? [Completeness, Spec §Dependencies]
- [ ] CHK410 Are nullable reference types utilized in requirements for data safety? [Gap, Spec §Constraints]
- [ ] CHK411 Is data validation specified at model boundaries? [Coverage, Gap]

## Godot C# Integration Requirements

- [ ] CHK412 Are Godot node references (GetNode patterns) consistently specified? [Consistency, Spec §Project Architecture]
- [ ] CHK413 Is signal connection pattern defined for C# scripts? [Clarity, Spec §Signal Communication]
- [ ] CHK414 Are Godot.Collections specified where required for Godot compatibility? [Completeness, Spec §Data Handling]
- [ ] CHK415 Is resource disposal (using statements, QueueFree) specified? [Coverage, Gap]

## Testing & Maintainability Requirements

- [ ] CHK416 Are contract tests specified for JSON schema validation? [Completeness, Spec §Verification]
- [ ] CHK417 Is integration testing approach defined for scene interactions? [Clarity, Spec §Verification]
- [ ] CHK418 Are C# naming conventions consistently applied in requirements? [Consistency, Spec §Constraints]

## Architecture Pattern Requirements

- [ ] CHK419 Is singleton pattern properly specified for autoload singletons? [Completeness, Spec §Project Architecture]
- [ ] CHK420 Are dependency relationships clearly defined to avoid circular dependencies? [Clarity, Gap]
- [ ] CHK421 Is separation of concerns specified between scene logic and UI presentation? [Completeness, Gap]

## Notes

This checklist emphasizes DRY principles and code reuse to ensure requirements specify shared utilities and patterns rather than duplicating logic across scenes. Focus on validating architectural decisions support maintainability and test coverage improvements.
