# Godot Integration Requirements Review Checklist

**Purpose**: Validate Godot 4.5 engine integration requirements for proper scene architecture, addon leverage, and DRY implementation
**Created**: 2025-10-11
**Feature**: specs/004-implement-omega-spiral/spec.md
**Focus**: Lightweight review for iterative development with emphasis on dialog addons and NobodyWho integration

## Scene Architecture Requirements

- [ ] CHK200 Are Godot scene file requirements (.tscn) clearly specified for all 5 game scenes? [Completeness, Spec §User Stories]
- [ ] CHK201 Is the scene transition flow explicitly defined using Godot's SceneTree API? [Clarity, Spec §Runtime Flow]
- [ ] CHK202 Are scene-specific node hierarchies documented to avoid redundant implementations? [DRY, Gap]
- [ ] CHK203 Is the autoload singleton pattern properly specified for SceneManager and GameState? [Completeness, Spec §Project Architecture]
- [ ] CHK204 Are scene loading requirements quantified (under 500ms target)? [Measurability, Spec §Performance]

## Addon Integration & DRY Requirements

- [ ] CHK205 Is NobodyWho addon integration clearly specified for Dreamweaver persona dialogues? [Completeness, Spec §Dependencies]
- [ ] CHK206 Are dialog system requirements defined to leverage existing Godot dialog addons? [DRY, Gap]
- [ ] CHK207 Is the shared model node structure documented to avoid duplicate LLM loading? [DRY, Gap]
- [ ] CHK208 Are addon-based solutions prioritized over custom implementations where available? [DRY, Gap]
- [ ] CHK209 Is the DreamweaverCore scene structure specified with proper node reuse? [Completeness, Spec §Project Architecture]

## Node Lifecycle & Signal Requirements

- [ ] CHK210 Are Godot node lifecycle methods (`_Ready`, `_Process`, `_Input`) requirements specified? [Completeness, Spec §Runtime Flow]
- [ ] CHK211 Is signal-based communication clearly defined between scenes and UI components? [Clarity, Spec §Signal Communication]
- [ ] CHK212 Are signal naming conventions documented to maintain consistency? [Consistency, Gap]
- [ ] CHK213 Is the input handling strategy defined using Godot's InputMap system? [Completeness, Spec §Input Handling]

## Resource Loading & Management Requirements

- [ ] CHK214 Are JSON resource loading patterns specified using Godot's FileAccess API? [Completeness, Spec §Data Handling]
- [ ] CHK215 Is the resource preloading strategy defined for performance optimization? [Gap, Spec §Performance]
- [ ] CHK216 Are asset organization requirements aligned with Godot's res:// path conventions? [Consistency, Spec §Asset Management]
- [ ] CHK217 Is GGUF model loading for NobodyWho clearly specified with single-instance requirement? [Completeness, Spec §Dependencies]

## Integration Testing Requirements

- [ ] CHK218 Are scene transition integration test scenarios defined? [Coverage, Spec §Verification]
- [ ] CHK219 Is addon functionality validation specified for NobodyWho persona responses? [Coverage, Gap]
- [ ] CHK220 Are UI component integration requirements testable in isolation? [Testability, Gap]

## Notes

This checklist focuses on Godot-specific integration requirements to ensure proper engine utilization, addon leverage, and DRY principles. Emphasis on validating that requirements specify reuse of existing systems (dialog addons, NobodyWho) rather than custom implementations.
