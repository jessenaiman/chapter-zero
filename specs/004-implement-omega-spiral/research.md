# Research Findings: Ωmega Spiral Godot 4 Implementation

## Decision: Godot 4.5 + C# 14 + .NET 10 RC Architecture

**Chosen Stack**: Godot 4.5 Mono runtime with C# 14 scripting and .NET 10 RC for high-performance game development with excellent cross-platform support and rich 2D game creation capabilities.

### Rationale
- Godot provides native scene system, node-based architecture, and excellent 2D rendering capabilities
- C# 14 offers modern language features and strong typing for maintainable game code
- .NET 10 RC provides latest runtime performance optimizations
- Native support for JSON data loading and scene management
- Strong community and documentation for game development patterns

### Alternatives Considered
- Unity: Considered but rejected due to licensing complexity and heavier runtime requirements
- Phaser.js: Considered but rejected due to lack of native executable export and dependency on web technologies
- Custom C++ engine: Considered but rejected due to development complexity and time requirements

## Technical Clarifications Resolved

### 1. Godot Project Structure & Node Architecture
**Decision**: Use Godot's standard project structure with organized Scenes, Scripts, and Data folders.

**Research Task**: "Research Godot 4.5 project structure and node architecture patterns"
- Godot projects use `.godot/` folder for project metadata and settings
- Scenes (.tscn files) contain node hierarchies and component references
- Scripts are attached to nodes and handle behavior logic
- Autoload singletons (like SceneManager) persist across scene changes
- Resources (.tres files) for reusable assets and configurations

**Implementation Pattern**:
```
project.godot                    # Project configuration
/Source/Scenes/                  # Scene files (.tscn)
  ├── Scene1Narrative.tscn
  ├── Scene2NethackSequence.tscn
  ...
/Source/Scripts/                 # C# behavior scripts
  ├── SceneManager.cs           # Autoload singleton
  ├── NarrativeTerminal.cs      # Scene-specific logic
  ...
/Source/Data/                    # JSON resources
  ├── manifest.json
  ├── scenes/scene1_narrative/
  ...
```

### 2. Asset Management Strategy
**Decision**: Use Godot's resource system for all assets with external JSON files for content data.

**Research Task**: "Find best practices for asset management in Godot 4.5 games"
- Godot's Resource system handles loading/saving of all asset types
- External JSON files for narrative content, dungeon layouts, and game data
- Godot's import system for textures, audio, and fonts
- ResourceLoader for dynamic loading of scene variants

**Asset Organization**:
```
/Source/UI/                      # UI scene files (.tscn)
/Assets/                         # Imported assets (auto-generated)
  ├── textures/
  ├── audio/
  ├── fonts/
/Source/Data/                    # Source JSON files
```

### 3. Input Handling Implementation
**Decision**: Use Godot's Input system with custom action mappings for cross-platform compatibility.

**Research Task**: "Research input handling patterns in Godot for retro-style games"
- Godot's ProjectSettings for input action definitions
- Input.IsActionPressed() for continuous input detection
- InputEvent system for discrete input events
- Custom input handling for ASCII dungeon navigation
- UI focus management for narrative terminal interface

**Input Mapping Strategy**:
```csharp
// Project Input Map Configuration
ui_accept = Space, Enter
ui_cancel = Escape
movement_up = W, Up Arrow, Gamepad D-pad Up
movement_down = S, Down Arrow, Gamepad D-pad Down
movement_left = A, Left Arrow, Gamepad D-pad Left
movement_right = D, Right Arrow, Gamepad D-pad Right
interact = Space, Enter, Gamepad A Button
```

### 4. Save/Load System Architecture
**Decision**: Use Godot's FileAccess system with JSON serialization for game state persistence.

**Research Task**: "Find best practices for save/load systems in Godot games"
- Godot's JSON class for serialization/deserialization
- FileAccess for platform-agnostic file operations
- ConfigFile for settings and preferences
- Custom serialization for complex game state objects

**Save System Design**:
```csharp
public void SaveGame()
{
    var saveData = new Godot.Collections.Dictionary<string, Variant>
    {
        ["player_name"] = PlayerName,
        ["dreamweaver_thread"] = DreamweaverThread,
        ["current_scene"] = CurrentScene,
        ["dreamweaver_scores"] = DreamweaverScores,
        ["party_data"] = PartyData
    };

    var jsonString = Json.Stringify(saveData);
    using var file = FileAccess.Open("user://savegame.json", FileAccess.ModeFlags.Write);
    file.StoreString(jsonString);
}
```

### 5. Scene Transition Management
**Decision**: Use Godot's SceneTree.ChangeSceneToFile() with custom transition animations.

**Research Task**: "Research scene transition patterns in Godot for smooth gameplay flow"
- SceneTree.ChangeSceneToFile() for immediate scene switching
- AnimationPlayer for transition effects
- Custom resource loading for scene preloading
- Signal-based communication between scenes via SceneManager singleton

**Transition Implementation**:
```csharp
// In SceneManager.cs (autoload)
public async void TransitionToScene(string scenePath)
{
    // Play transition animation
    var transitionAnimation = GetNode<AnimationPlayer>("TransitionAnimation");
    transitionAnimation.Play("fade_to_black");

    await ToSignal(transitionAnimation, "animation_finished");

    // Change scene
    GetTree().ChangeSceneToFile(scenePath);

    transitionAnimation.Play("fade_from_black");
}
```

### 6. Cross-Platform Deployment Strategy
**Decision**: Use Godot's export system for Windows and Linux standalone executables.

**Research Task**: "Find deployment best practices for Godot games on Windows and Linux"
- Godot export presets for Windows and Linux
- .NET runtime bundling for standalone executables
- Platform-specific optimizations and settings
- Testing across different hardware configurations

**Export Configuration**:
- Windows: Export with embedded .NET runtime for easy distribution
- Linux: Export with system .NET dependencies for smaller file size
- Both platforms: Include all JSON data files and assets in export

### 7. Performance Optimization Patterns
**Decision**: Implement Godot-specific optimization patterns for 60 FPS target.

**Research Task**: "Research performance optimization techniques for Godot 4.5 games"
- Object pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects
- Texture atlasing for UI and sprite assets
- Efficient node hierarchies to minimize draw calls
- Godot's profiling tools for performance analysis

**Performance Targets**:
- 60 FPS minimum across all scenes
- Scene transitions under 500ms
- JSON loading under 100ms
- Memory usage under 500MB
- No frame drops during gameplay
