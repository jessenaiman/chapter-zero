# Tasks: Œ©mega Spiral Godot 4 Implementation

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/002-using-godot-4/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are REQUIRED following player-driven TDD approach. Tests validate player interactions and game state changes, enabling MVP validation while implementation completes. Contract tests validate data schemas; integration tests validate player experience scenarios.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Godot Project**: `/Source/Scenes/`, `/Source/Scripts/`, `/Source/Data/`, `/Source/UI/`, `/Tests/`
- Paths shown below follow the planned Godot project structure

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2/US3 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 5 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2/US3/US4 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 6 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Integrates with all previous stories for state management

### Within Each User Story

- Models before services
- Services before scene implementation
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all models for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create NarrativeSceneData model in /Source/Scripts/NarrativeSceneData.cs"
Task: "Create DreamweaverChoice model in /Source/Scripts/DreamweaverChoice.cs"

# Launch scene and script creation together:
Task: "Create Scene1Narrative.tscn scene file in /Source/Scenes/Scene1Narrative.tscn"
Task: "Create NarrativeTerminal.cs script in /Source/Scripts/NarrativeTerminal.cs"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
6. Add User Story 5 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
7. Add User Story 6 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
8. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 2
   - Developer C: User Story 3
   - Developer D: User Story 4
   - Developer E: User Story 5
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Each user story maintains the Godot project structure and C# 14 architecture

## MVP Focus

- **Functional completeness** over performance optimization
- **Player experience validation** over strict metrics
- **Iterative improvement** - optimize after core gameplay validates
- Performance targets deferred to post-MVP: Focus on responsiveness, not specific FPS/timing
- Test coverage target: >30% for MVP, >50% for production (Constitution compliance)
