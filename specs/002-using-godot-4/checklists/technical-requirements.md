## Notes

This checklist validates technical requirements quality for the Ωmega Spiral Godot 4.5 + C# 14 implementation. Focus is on requirement clarity, completeness, and implementation-readiness rather than testing the actual game functionality.

Key areas needing attention:
- Asset management and loading strategies
- Error handling and debugging approaches
- Platform-specific compatibility requirements
- Integration and testing strategies for scene interactions
