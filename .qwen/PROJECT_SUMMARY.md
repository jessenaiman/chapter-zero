# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Implement a terminal window system with frame-constrained content architecture that adapts to various frame sizes (400x300 dialog to 3840x2160 full-screen) while maintaining proper CRT aesthetic effects, centering, and overflow protection across different game contexts (stage select menu, NPC dialogs, settings screens).

## Key Knowledge
- **Architecture**: OmegaWindow inherits from TerminalBase, providing frame-constrained content that adapts to any frame size
- **Scene Structure**: Uses stage_select_menu.tscn and main_menu.tscn with TerminalFrame, shader layers (Phosphor, Scanline, Glitch), and proper terminal styling
- **Testing Framework**: Uses GdUnit4 for C# testing with scene runners for Ui layout tests
- **Build System**: Uses Godot with C# and dotnet for project management
- **File Locations**:
  - Core: `/source/scripts/ui/terminal/OmegaWindow.cs`
  - Scenes: `/source/ui/menus/stage_select_menu.tscn`, `/source/ui/menus/main_menu.tscn`
  - Tests: `/tests/ui/terminal/OmegaWindowFrameLayoutTests.cs`
- **Script Reference Fix**: Main menu scene now correctly references `res://source/ui/menus/MainMenu.cs` instead of non-existent `StageSelectMenu.cs`
- **Test Base Class**: Created `OmegaWindowLayoutTestBase` with common test utilities and constants

## Recent Actions
- **[DONE]** Identified and fixed script reference mismatch in main_menu.tscn (pointing to non-existent StageSelectMenu.cs)
- **[DONE]** Added missing StartButton and OptionsButton to main_menu.tscn to match MainMenu.cs script expectations
- **[DONE]** Implemented comprehensive OmegaWindow frame-constrained architecture tests covering all 6 phases from TDD plan
- **[DONE]** Created shared base class for terminal window tests with common utilities and constants
- **[DONE]** Fixed major syntax errors in test files that were preventing compilation
- **[DONE]** Corrected assertion methods and node path references in tests to match actual scene structure
- **[DONE]** Addressed Godot API compatibility issues in tests (fixed Control.Grow_direction_both references)

## Current Plan
- **[DONE]** Fix test compilation errors and ensure build succeeds
- **[DONE]** Verify menu crashes are resolved after script reference fix
- **[DONE]** Ensure the terminal styling now appears correctly with proper CRT effects
- **[IN PROGRESS]** Validate that all terminal window functionality works across different frame sizes (400x300 to 3840x2160)
- **[IN PROGRESS]** Confirm frame-constrained content architecture prevents overflow and maintains proper centering
- **[TODO]** Run comprehensive test suite to verify all 25+ implemented tests pass
- **[TODO]** Validate integration with stage selection and other game contexts
