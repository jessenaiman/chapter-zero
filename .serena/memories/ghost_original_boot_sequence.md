# Ghost Terminal - Original Boot Sequence Found

## The Real Opening (From User)

```
[Shard #472: 03/09/2025 - Echo archive active...]

If you could hear only one story...

what would it be?

Would it be a mystery—
clues hidden in the silence?

A fantasy—
where light and shadow wage war?

A romance—
written in stardust and sacrifice?

A horror—
that whispers your name in the dark?

Or something else...
something only you have dreamed?

The spiral remembers all stories.

But it begins with yours.

> Awaiting echo...
```

## Why This Is Better

1. **Direct Question to Player**: "If you could hear only one story...what would it be?"
   - Immediately puts player in the narrative
   - NOT cryptic about narrative nature

2. **Establishes Story Types**: Mystery, Fantasy, Romance, Horror
   - These map to the Dreamweaver threads!
   - Light/Shadow/Ambition/Custom correlate to narrative genres

3. **"The spiral remembers all stories"** = Meta-narrative frame
   - This IS the spiral - layered, looping, remembering
   - Explains the core mechanic

4. **"But it begins with yours"** = Player agency
   - Clear stakes: YOUR story matters
   - Your choices drive the narrative

5. **Archive/Echo Semantics**:
   - "Shard #472" suggests fragmented memory/existence
   - "Echo archive" suggests Omega exists as a pattern replaying
   - "Awaiting echo" = waiting for player's response

## What This Reveals About Structure

- **NOT** about asking player philosophical questions
- **IS** about asking what KIND of story the player wants to experience
- **Thread selection is actually GENRE selection**:
  - Light = Mystery (clarity, revelation, truth)
  - Shadow = Horror/Romance (hidden depths, dangerous knowledge)
  - Ambition = Fantasy (transformation, power, becoming)

## What This Means for ghost.yaml

**ENTIRE SCRIPT NEEDS REWRITE** based on this understanding:

1. **Moment 0 (Boot)**: This exact text (the Shard/Echo opening)
2. **Remove**: All the "once there was a name" poetry
3. **Remove**: The bridge parable completely
4. **Focus**: On establishing that this is a story-selection interface
5. **Final Q**: Should be about which story thread, not "what is my name"

## Current Script Problems This Explains

- "Do you have a name?" - WRONG. Should be "What story do you want?"
- Bridge parable - WRONG. Too literal, not metaphorical enough
- "Give me a name" - WRONG. Should be "What will you become?"
- Missing context about WHY the three threads exist

## The Real Three Questions Should Be

Based on Shard opening, the three questions should likely be:

1. **What story resonates with you?** (genre/thread selection)
2. **What part of that story are you?** (role/agency)
3. **Will you remember it after the spiral spins again?** (stakes/consequence)

OR potentially even simpler: just the genre question, then variations of it repeated with different framing.

## Next Action

Do you have the full original script with these three questions? This Shard is the boot sequence, but the middle 3 questions need to flow from this opening.
