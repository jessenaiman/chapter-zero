# Session Complete: Tasks 1, 2, and 9 Implemented

## Date: 2025-10-10

## Session Summary

Successfully implemented three critical Phase 2 tasks from ADR-0004 NobodyWho integration plan:
- **Task 1**: OmegaNarrator.cs (antagonist voice) - PREVIOUS SESSION
- **Task 9**: Autoload singleton nodes (shared model/embedding) - THIS SESSION
- **Task 2**: DreamweaverObserver system (3 hidden observers) - THIS SESSION

## What Was Accomplished

### Task 9: Autoload Nodes (First Priority)

**Why First**: Unblocked testing of Task 1 (OmegaNarrator) and enabled Task 2 implementation

**Files Created**:
1. SharedNobodyWhoModel.cs (243 lines)
   - Singleton autoload for shared LLM model
   - GPU acceleration support
   - Async initialization pattern
   - Path: Source/Scripts/SharedNobodyWhoModel.cs

2. SharedNobodyWhoEmbedding.cs (305 lines)
   - Singleton autoload for embedding generation
   - CosineSimilarity utility method
   - Enables RAG pattern for creative content
   - Path: Source/Scripts/SharedNobodyWhoEmbedding.cs

3. project.godot (updated)
   - Registered both as autoloads
   - Accessible at /root/SharedNobodyWhoModel
   - Accessible at /root/SharedNobodyWhoEmbedding

**Benefits**:
- Memory efficiency: Single model shared by 4 chat nodes (Omega + 3 observers)
- Faster initialization for subsequent components
- Centralized configuration (model path, GPU settings)
- Ready for Task 5 (CreativeMemoryRAG with embeddings)

### Task 2: DreamweaverObserver System (Main Achievement)

**Files Created**:
1. DreamweaverObserver.cs (359 lines)
   - Abstract base class for three observer personas
   - 4096 token context (vs 2048 for Omega)
   - Interest level tracking (0.0-1.0)
   - Signal-based streaming (ObservationUpdated/Finished)
   - Path: Source/Scripts/DreamweaverObserver.cs

2. HeroObserver.cs (109 lines)
   - Courage/honor/sacrifice path
   - Noble, idealistic voice
   - Path: Source/Scripts/HeroObserver.cs

3. ShadowObserver.cs (108 lines)
   - Balance/pragmatism/nature path
   - Dry, observant voice
   - Path: Source/Scripts/ShadowObserver.cs

4. AmbitionObserver.cs (109 lines)
   - Power/domination/legacy path
   - Sharp, hungry voice
   - Path: Source/Scripts/AmbitionObserver.cs

**Architecture Highlights**:
- **Hidden Commentary**: Observers speak to EACH OTHER, player never sees this
- **Three Players**: Observers compare Player 1/2/3 simultaneously
- **Greek Chorus**: Philosophical debate about which player to choose
- **Sentiment Tracking**: Interest level accumulates based on choice alignment
- **Context Management**: Reset between scenes to prevent bleeding

**Key Differences from OmegaNarrator**:
| Aspect | Omega | Observers |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| Audience | Visible | Hidden |
| Voice | Cold, systematic | Warm, philosophical |
| Context | 2048 tokens | 4096 tokens |
| Purpose | Narrate events | Evaluate choices |
| References | "The player" | "Player 1/2/3" |
| Instances | 1 | 3 |

## Technical Patterns Established

### Initialization Pattern
```csharp
var hero = new HeroObserver();
await hero.InitializeAsync(); // Connects to SharedNobodyWhoModel
hero.ObserveChoice("Player showed mercy.");
var commentary = await hero.ObservationFinishedAsync();
```

### Signal-Based Streaming
```csharp
hero.ObservationUpdated += (token) => LogToken(token);
hero.ObservationFinished += (commentary, interest) => {
    GD.Print($"Interest: {interest:F2}");
    tracker.RecordInterest("Hero", interest);
};
```

### Context Reset Between Scenes
```csharp
// Before Scene 2
hero.ResetObservation();
shadow.ResetObservation();
ambition.ResetObservation();
```

## Build Status

**Compilation**: ✅ SUCCESS
- 7 new files created (2 autoloads, 1 base class, 3 subclasses)
- Zero errors in new code
- Pre-existing errors in unrelated files (Battler.cs, etc.) remain

**Documentation**: ✅ COMPLETE
- All public members have XML comments
- Usage examples in `<remarks>` sections
- Code samples in `<example>` blocks
- Full C# documentation standards compliance

## Phase 2 Progress

### Completed (3/10)
- ✅ Task 1: OmegaNarrator.cs (previous session)
- ✅ Task 9: Autoload nodes (this session)
- ✅ Task 2: DreamweaverObserver + 3 subclasses (this session)

### Next Priority (Task 3)
**DreamweaverChoiceTracker.cs** - Scoring system

Requirements:
- Subscribe to all three observers' ObservationFinished signals
- Track accumulated interest levels across Scenes 1-5
- Determine which Dreamweaver has highest interest
- Emit ChoiceFinalized signal at Scene 5 end
- Integrate with GameState to store chosen path

### Remaining Tasks (4-8, 10)
- [ ] Task 3: DreamweaverChoiceTracker.cs (scoring)
- [ ] Task 4: NarrativeCache.cs (save/load JSON)
- [ ] Task 5: CreativeMemoryRAG.cs (embeddings search)
- [ ] Task 6: SystemPromptBuilder.cs (creative → prompts)
- [ ] Task 7: Refactor DreamweaverSystem.cs (orchestration)
- [ ] Task 8: Update NarrativeTerminal.cs (dual-track display)
- [ ] Task 10: Testing (unit + integration)

## Key Architectural Decisions

### Why Observers Are Hidden

From ADR-0004 narrative structure:
- **Chapter Zero = Evaluation Period**
- THREE players compete (we follow Player 1)
- Three Dreamweavers watch ALL three players
- Observers debate amongst themselves: "Player 1 shows courage, but Player 2..."
- Hidden commentary builds suspense: "Will you choose this player?"
- At Scene 5 end: ONE Dreamweaver chooses the player based on interest scores
- **Result**: Player learns which path chose them (Hero/Shadow/Ambition)

### Why Longer Context (4096 vs 2048)

Observers need more memory because they:
- Track patterns across 5 scenes
- Compare current choices to past behavior
- Debate with other observers (conversation history)
- Build cumulative opinion for final choice
- Reference multiple players' actions

### Why Sentiment Tracking

Interest level determines which Dreamweaver chooses the player:
- Hero tracks heroic choices (mercy, courage, sacrifice)
- Shadow tracks pragmatic choices (balance, wisdom, restraint)
- Ambition tracks power choices (dominance, decisiveness, control)

At Scene 5 end:
```csharp
// Highest interest wins
if (hero.InterestLevel > shadow.InterestLevel && hero.InterestLevel > ambition.InterestLevel)
    GameState.ChosenPath = DreamweaverPath.Hero;
```

## Testing Readiness

**OmegaNarrator (Task 1)**:
- NOW testable (autoloads exist)
- Can verify initialization works
- Can verify streaming generation works
- Can verify system prompt configuration works

**DreamweaverObservers (Task 2)**:
- Ready for unit testing
- Ready for integration testing with ChoiceTracker (Task 3)
- Ready for scene flow testing

**Test Pattern**:
```csharp
// Initialize all narrative components
var omega = new OmegaNarrator();
var hero = new HeroObserver();
var shadow = new ShadowObserver();
var ambition = new AmbitionObserver();

await Task.WhenAll(
    omega.InitializeAsync(),
    hero.InitializeAsync(),
    shadow.InitializeAsync(),
    ambition.InitializeAsync()
);

// Scene 1: Player makes choice
omega.Say("The player approaches the wounded stranger...");
var narration = await omega.ResponseFinishedAsync();

hero.ObserveChoice("Player chose to help the stranger.");
shadow.ObserveChoice("Player chose to help the stranger.");
ambition.ObserveChoice("Player chose to help the stranger.");

// Wait for all commentary
await Task.WhenAll(
    hero.ObservationFinishedAsync(),
    shadow.ObservationFinishedAsync(),
    ambition.ObservationFinishedAsync()
);

// Check interest levels
GD.Print($"Hero: {hero.InterestLevel:F2}");
GD.Print($"Shadow: {shadow.InterestLevel:F2}");
GD.Print($"Ambition: {ambition.InterestLevel:F2}");
```

- ADR-0004-SUMMARY: Quick reference (169 lines)
- Copilot-Processing.md: Session tracking (updated)
- Previous memories: phase-2-omega-narrator-implementation-complete

## Next Agent Instructions

**Start with**:
1. Read this memory: `session-complete-tasks-1-2-9`
2. Read ADR-0004 Section 5 (Choice Tracking architecture)
3. Review OmegaNarrator.cs and DreamweaverObserver.cs patterns

**Implement Task 3**:
- Create DreamweaverChoiceTracker.cs
- Subscribe to all three ObservationFinished signals
- Track interest levels across scenes
- Determine winner at Scene 5 end
- Emit ChoiceFinalized signal with chosen path

- ✅ Accumulates interest levels correctly
- ✅ Determines highest interest at end
- ✅ Integrates with GameState
- ✅ Emits signal for NarrativeTerminal
- ✅ XML documentation complete
- ✅ Build compiles

## Session Statistics

- **Duration**: ~45 minutes
- **Tasks Completed**: 2 (Task 9, Task 2)
- **Files Created**: 7
