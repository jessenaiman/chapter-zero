## CreditsMenu Reparenting Execution Sequence Issue

### Current Problem
The CallDeferred timing breaks the menu button attachment pattern:

**Current Execution Order:**
1. CreditsMenu._Ready() calls `base._Ready()`
2. MenuUi._Ready() calls `PopulateMenuButtons()`
3. PopulateMenuButtons() calls `AddMenuButton("Back", OnBackPressed)`
4. AddMenuButton() throws InvalidOperationException because MenuButtonContainer = null (lookup failed pre-reparenting)
5. Then `CallDeferred(nameof(CacheCreditsNodes))` â†’ executes next frame (too late!)
6. OmegaThemedContainer reparents ContentContainer into CrtFrame during its lifecycle

### Root Cause
MenuUi.CacheRequiredNodes() runs BEFORE reparenting, so MenuButtonContainer lookup fails because it's still under ContentContainer (not yet inside CrtFrame).

### Solution Pattern
Two viable approaches:

**Option A: Defer PopulateMenuButtons (SIMPLER)**
- Override _Ready in CreditsMenu to defer base._Ready() itself
- Pro: Single defer call, natural flow
- Con: Changes base._Ready semantics

**Option B: Re-cache in Deferred Callback (CLEANER)**
- Keep current structure but have CacheCreditsNodes also call base.ReCacheRequiredNodes()
- Then PopulateMenuButtons after ReCacheRequiredNodes
- Pro: Respects Godot lifecycle, explicit ordering
- Con: More steps

**Option C: Call ReCacheRequiredNodes Immediately in _Ready (BEST)**
- In CreditsMenu._Ready after base._Ready(), explicitly call ReCacheRequiredNodes()
- Then call PopulateMenuButtons via deferred if still needed
- Pro: Direct control, clear intent
- Con: Bypasses automatic lifecycle call

### Architecture
- OmegaThemedContainer.CreateComponents() reparents ContentContainer into CrtFrame
- This happens in OmegaUi initialization (before _Ready)
- MenuUi.CacheRequiredNodes() called during OmegaUi init (pre-reparent)
- MenuUi.ReCacheRequiredNodes() designed to re-cache post-reparent
- Currently ReCacheRequiredNodes NOT called in CreditsMenu lifecycle

### Implementation
CreditsMenu._Ready should:
1. Call `base._Ready()` (creates PopulateMenuButtons call)
2. Then immediately call `ReCacheRequiredNodes()` to re-cache MenuButtonContainer post-reparent
3. Then `PopulateMenuButtons()` via deferred if needed, or moved to _Ready completion

Or simpler: Move entire PopulateMenuButtons into deferred chain.
