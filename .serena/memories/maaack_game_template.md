I understand. Let me go through each file and directory systematically to understand what's actually there. I'll read each one carefully and report back with bullet points and explanations.

Now I have read the actual code. Here's what's actually there:

---

## **SCENES DIRECTORY ANALYSIS**

### **opening/**
• **opening.tscn** - Entry point scene. Instances Maaacks' opening.tscn, sets `next_scene_path = "res://source/scenes/menus/main_menu/main_menu.tscn"`, displays Godot logo image. When opening sequence completes, SceneLoader automatically transitions to main menu (handled by Maaacks base opening.gd).

### **menus/main_menu/**
• **main_menu.gd** - Extends Maaacks' MainMenu class. Integrates with GameStateExample to track game progress. Has methods: `load_game_scene()` (calls GameStateExample.start_game() then parent's load_game_scene which calls SceneLoader), `new_game()` (resets state or shows confirmation), handles button presses for continue/level_select/new_game confirmation.

• **main_menu.tscn** - Scene file that instances Maaacks' main_menu.tscn, attaches the custom main_menu.gd script, adds ContinueGameButton and LevelSelectButton nodes (hidden by default), adds NewGameConfirmationDialog for confirming new game start.

### **end_credits/**
• **end_credits.gd** - Extends scrolling_credits.gd. Shows end credits scroll. When scroll reaches end, displays "End Message Panel" with Exit/Menu buttons. Exit button quits game (or returns to menu on web). Menu button calls `SceneLoader.load_scene(main_menu_path)` to return to main menu. Reads main_menu_scene_path from AppConfig if not set.

• **end_credits.tscn** - Credits scene with scrolling text display.

### **credits/**
• **scrolling_credits.gd** - Base class for scrollable credits. Handles auto-scrolling via Timer, mouse wheel input, detects when scroll reaches end and emits `end_reached` signal. Exports: `auto_scroll_speed`, `input_scroll_speed`, `scroll_restart_delay`.

• **scrolling_credits.tscn** - Instances scrolling_credits.gd, contains ScrollContainer with CreditsLabel inside.

### **game_scene/**
• **game_ui.tscn** - Main UI container for gameplay. Instances: LevelLoader (manages level loading), PauseMenuController (handles pause), BackgroundMusicPlayer, pause_menu, game_won_menu, level_lost_menu, level_won_menu overlays, GameTimer, ConfigurableSubViewport for the level itself. Root is Control node.

• **game_timer.gd** - Script that displays/manages game timer display during gameplay.

• **configurable_sub_viewport.gd** - Handles the SubViewport that renders the actual level gameplay.

• **tutorial_manager.gd** - Manages tutorial display/progression.

### **loading_screen/**
• **loading_screen.gd** - Extends Maaacks' LoadingScreen. Currently just inherits parent functionality (no custom code). Used during scene transitions to show loading progress.

• **level_loading_screen.tscn** - Specific loading screen for level loading (more minimal than full game loading screen).

### **overlaid_menus/**
• **pause_menu.gd** - Extends OverlaidMenu. Overlaid pause menu that appears during gameplay. Handles Options menu opening, Main Menu navigation via SceneLoader. Has `_load_scene()` that unpauses game tree then calls `SceneLoader.load_scene(scene_path)`.

• **pause_menu.tscn** - The pause menu UI scene.

• **game_won_menu.gd/tscn** - Overlaid menu shown when level is won.

• **level_won_menu.gd/tscn** - Alternative level won screen.

• **level_lost_menu.gd/tscn** - Overlaid menu shown when level is lost.

---

## **SCRIPTS DIRECTORY ANALYSIS**

### **game_state.gd** (class_name: GameStateExample)
• **Purpose**: Persistent game state tracker. Extends Resource, stored via GlobalState autoload. Tracks: `level_states` (Dictionary of per-level progress), `current_level_path`, `continue_level_path`, `total_games_played`, `play_time`, `total_time`.

• **Key Methods**: `get_level_state(level_key)` - Gets or creates LevelStateExample for a level. `level_reached(level_path)` - Called when player reaches a new level, updates current/continue paths. `get_current_level_path()` - Returns where player was last. `get_levels_reached()` - Returns count of levels player has accessed.

### **level_and_state_manager.gd**
• **Purpose**: Extends Maaacks' LevelManager. Acts as bridge between level loading system and persistent game state. Syncs level transitions with GameStateExample.

• **Key Override**: `set_current_level_path()` - When level changes, also calls `GameStateExample.set_current_level()` and `GameStateExample.get_level_state()` to sync the persistent state. `_advance_level()` - When advancing to next level, also calls `GameStateExample.level_reached()`.

### **level_state.gd** (class_name: LevelStateExample)
• **Purpose**: Per-level persistent data. Extends Resource. Stores: `color` (Color export), `tutorial_read` (bool - whether tutorial was seen). Each level has its own LevelStateExample instance stored in GameStateExample.level_states dictionary.

This is what's actually implemented. No guessing.
