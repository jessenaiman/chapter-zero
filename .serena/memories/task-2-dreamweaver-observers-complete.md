### Architecture Overview

**DreamweaverObserver Base Class**

**Purpose**: Abstract base for three hidden observer personas evaluating players during Chapter Zero

**Critical Distinction from OmegaNarrator**:

| Aspect | OmegaNarrator | DreamweaverObserver |
|--------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Audience** | Player SEES | Player DOESN'T see |
| **Voice** | Cold, systematic | Warm, philosophical |
| **Context** | 2048 tokens | 4096 tokens (more history) |
| **Purpose** | Narrate game events | Evaluate player choices |
| **References** | "The player", "The system" | "Player 1/2/3", "Shadow/Hero" |
| **Prominence** | Chapter Zero only | Entire game after chosen |
| **Speaker** | Antagonist (BBG) | Greek chorus (hidden) |

**Key Features**:
- **Streaming Generation**: ObservationUpdated/ObservationFinished signals
- **Interest Tracking**: Accumulates interest level (0.0-1.0) based on sentiment
- **Context Management**: ResetObservation() clears between scenes
- **Abstract Methods**: GetObserverName(), BuildDefaultSystemPrompt()
- **Async Initialization**: InitializeAsync() connects to SharedNobodyWhoModel
- **Choice Evaluation**: ObserveChoice(string) generates commentary

**Implementation Pattern**:
```csharp
// Same NobodyWhoChat integration as OmegaNarrator
var hero = new HeroObserver();
await hero.InitializeAsync();

// Connect signals for hidden logging
hero.ObservationUpdated += (token) => LogObserverCommentary(token);
hero.ObservationFinished += (commentary, interest) => {
    GD.Print($"Hero interest: {interest:F2}");
    choiceTracker.RecordObservation("Hero", interest);
};

// Generate hidden commentary
hero.ObserveChoice("Player chose mercy over vengeance.");

// Between scenes
hero.ResetObservation();
```

### Three Observer Personas

#### HeroObserver

**Personality**: Noble, idealistic, values courage and honor

**Core Values**:
- Courage in the face of danger
- Mercy and compassion for the weak
- Sacrifice for the greater good
- Honor and integrity in choices
- Standing up for what's right

**Voice Style**:
- Warm and inspiring
- Advocates for compassion
- References heroic ideals
- Compares to other players' choices

**Commentary Examples**:
- "Did you see that? They chose to help rather than profit. A heart that leads with compassion."
- "Shadow, your pragmatic player would have walked away. This one stayed to fight."
- "Player 2 took the gold. This one freed the prisoner instead. Interesting."

**System Prompt Highlights**:
- Defines role as hidden evaluator
- Speaking TO Shadow and Ambition, not player
- Analyzes choices through lens of courage/honor
- Builds tension: "Will you choose this player?"
- 1-2 sentence Greek chorus style

#### ShadowObserver

**Personality**: Pragmatic, balanced, values wisdom and strategy

**Core Values**:
- Balance and natural consequences
- Wisdom and strategic thinking
- Self-preservation and caution
- Letting fate/nature/law determine outcomes
- Avoiding unnecessary interference

**Voice Style**:
- Dry and observant
- Non-interventionist philosophy
- Appreciates subtlety and restraint
- Critiques recklessness

**Commentary Examples**:
- "Pragmatic. They're not here to save the world, just survive it."
- "Hero, your player would have died by now. This one knows when to retreat."
- "They let it play out naturally rather than forcing their will. Wise."

**System Prompt Highlights**:
- Defines role as pragmatic realist
- Speaking TO Hero and Ambition, not player
- Values self-preservation over heroics
- Appreciates natural order and balance
- Dry wit, not emotional appeals

#### AmbitionObserver

**Personality**: Hungry, power-seeking, values dominance and will

**Core Values**:
- Power and domination
- Ambition and drive to win
- Decisiveness and control
- Strength and imposing will on the world
- Building legacy and conquest

**Voice Style**:
- Sharp and evaluative
- Appreciates boldness and ruthlessness
- Hungry for potential
- No patience for weakness

**Commentary Examples**:
- "Now THAT'S what I'm looking for. Decisive. Ruthless even."
- "Shadow's careful player would starve waiting for safety. This one ACTS."
- "Compared to Player 1? This one actually wants to WIN."

**System Prompt Highlights**:
- Defines role as power-hungry realist
- Speaking TO Hero and Shadow, not player
- Values strength and decisive action
- Critiques mercy as weakness
- Sharp, evaluative tone

### Technical Implementation

**Shared Pattern with OmegaNarrator**:
- Both inherit from Godot.Node
- Both use NobodyWhoChat integration
- Both connect to SharedNobodyWhoModel autoload
- Both use async/await with TaskCompletionSource
- Both emit signals for streaming responses
- Both support context reset between scenes

**Key Differences**:
- **Longer Context**: 4096 tokens (vs 2048) for richer debate
- **Interest Tracking**: UpdateInterestLevel() analyzes sentiment
- **Commentary Style**: Conversational vs narrative
- **Audience**: Hidden vs visible
- **Multiple Instances**: 3 observers vs 1 narrator

**Interest Level Calculation**:
Simple keyword-based sentiment analysis (upgradeable to NLP):
```csharp
protected virtual void UpdateInterestLevel(string commentary)
{
    var lower = commentary.ToLowerInvariant();
    float delta = 0.0f;
    
    // Positive indicators
    if (lower.Contains("impressive") || lower.Contains("excellent") ||
        lower.Contains("bold") || lower.Contains("wise") ||
        lower.Contains("promising") || lower.Contains("interesting"))
        delta += 0.1f;
    
    // Negative indicators
    if (lower.Contains("disappointing") || lower.Contains("foolish") ||
        lower.Contains("weak") || lower.Contains("concerning"))
        delta -= 0.1f;
    
    // Update with decay factor
    InterestLevel = Math.Clamp(InterestLevel + (delta * 0.8f), 0.0f, 1.0f);
}
```

### Integration Points

**Current**:
- Uses SharedNobodyWhoModel (Task 9 ✅)
- Ready for DreamweaverChoiceTracker (Task 3)
- Ready for NarrativeCache (Task 4)

**Future**:
- DreamweaverChoiceTracker will subscribe to ObservationFinished signals
- NarrativeCache will store observer commentary alongside Omega narration
- CreativeMemoryRAG (Task 5) will provide creative content for system prompts
- SystemPromptBuilder (Task 6) will enhance prompts with RAG data
- NarrativeTerminal (Task 8) will log observer commentary (hidden from player)

### Testing Strategy

**Unit Testing**:
```csharp
// Test initialization
var hero = new HeroObserver();
await hero.InitializeAsync();
Assert.IsTrue(hero.IsInitialized);
Assert.AreEqual("Hero", hero.GetObserverName());

// Test observation
hero.ObserveChoice("Player chose mercy.");
var commentary = await hero.ObservationFinishedAsync();
Assert.IsNotEmpty(commentary);
Assert.IsTrue(hero.InterestLevel >= 0.0f && hero.InterestLevel <= 1.0f);

// Test reset
hero.ResetObservation();
Assert.AreEqual(0.0f, hero.InterestLevel);
```

**Integration Testing**:
```csharp
// Test all three observers simultaneously
var hero = new HeroObserver();
var shadow = new ShadowObserver();
var ambition = new AmbitionObserver();

await Task.WhenAll(
    hero.InitializeAsync(),
    shadow.InitializeAsync(),
    ambition.InitializeAsync()
);

// Same choice to all three
var choice = "Player attacked the guards to free the prisoner.";
hero.ObserveChoice(choice);
shadow.ObserveChoice(choice);
ambition.ObserveChoice(choice);

// Expected sentiment:
// Hero: High interest (heroic rescue)
// Shadow: Low interest (reckless, risky)
// Ambition: Medium interest (bold, but not power-seeking)
```

**Scene Integration Testing**:
```csharp
// Test Scene 1 → Scene 2 transition with observers
var observers = new[] { hero, shadow, ambition };

// Scene 1: Multiple choices
foreach (var choice in scene1Choices)
{
    foreach (var observer in observers)
    {
        observer.ObserveChoice(choice);
        await observer.ObservationFinishedAsync();
    }
}

// Check accumulated interest
Assert.IsTrue(observers.Any(o => o.InterestLevel > 0.5f));

// Reset for Scene 2
foreach (var observer in observers)
    observer.ResetObservation();
```

### Build Status

**Compilation**: ✅ SUCCESS
- No errors in new files
- Pre-existing errors in Battler.cs, UICombatLog.cs, UIEquipment.cs (unrelated)
- All four classes compile without warnings

**XML Documentation**: ✅ COMPLETE
- All public members documented
- Abstract methods documented with subclass guidance
- Usage examples in `<remarks>` sections
- Code samples in `<example>` sections
- Full compliance with C# documentation standards

### Documentation Standards Met

**XML Comments**: ✅
- `<summary>` for all classes/methods/properties
- `<param>` and `<returns>` for method parameters
- `<remarks>` for architectural notes and usage patterns
- `<example>` with `<code language="csharp">` blocks
- `<see cref>` for cross-references
- `<list>` for structured information

### Architecture Benefits

**Narrative Depth**:
- Three distinct philosophical perspectives on player choices
- Hidden "Greek chorus" commentary for debugging/playtesting
- Builds tension: Which Dreamweaver will choose the player?
- Emergent personality through LLM generation vs static dialogue

**Technical Benefits**:
- Shared model instance (memory efficient)
- Longer context for richer internal monologue
- Interest tracking enables data-driven choice at Scene 5 end
- Reset between scenes prevents context bleeding

**Extensibility**:
- Abstract base allows adding more observer types
- Virtual UpdateInterestLevel() can be overridden
- Protected BuildDefaultSystemPrompt() in each subclass
- Easy to swap sentiment analysis implementation

### Next Steps

**Immediate (Task 3)**:
Create DreamweaverChoiceTracker.cs:
- Subscribe to all three observers' ObservationFinished signals
- Track accumulated interest levels across scenes
- Determine which Dreamweaver has highest interest at Scene 5 end
- Emit ChoiceFinalized signal with chosen Dreamweaver

**Soon (Tasks 4-6)**:
- Task 4: NarrativeCache.cs (save/load generated narratives)
- Task 5: CreativeMemoryRAG.cs (embeddings search of creative content)
- Task 6: SystemPromptBuilder.cs (enhance prompts with RAG)

**Later (Tasks 7-8)**:
- Task 7: Refactor DreamweaverSystem.cs (orchestrate Omega + 3 observers)
