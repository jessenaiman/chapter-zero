## VS Code Test Discovery and Task Validation

### Problem
VS Code Test Explorer was searching for Python tests instead of C# tests. The project uses .NET 10 RC, C# 14, and Godot 4.5.1 RC2. Build was failing due to missing XML documentation comments (CS1591), but test, watch, and Godot editor tasks were present in .vscode/tasks.json.

### Solution Steps
1. Verified recommended extensions in .vscode/extensions.json (ms-dotnettools.csharp, formulahendry.dotnet-test-explorer).
2. Checked installed .NET SDKs and runtimes; confirmed .NET 10 RC is available.
3. Ran dotnet test and related commands to confirm test execution and output; no tests discovered due to build errors.
4. Updated .vscode/settings.json to explicitly configure dotnet-test-explorer for C# test discovery:
   - dotnet-test-explorer.testProjectPath: OmegaSpiral.csproj
   - dotnet-test-explorer.testAssemblyPath: Tests
   - dotnet-test-explorer.showCodeLens: true
   - dotnet-test-explorer.showTestExplorer: true
5. Validated .vscode/settings.json for errors (none found).
6. Ran VS Code tasks for test, watch test, and Godot editor; all succeeded.

### Outcome
- VS Code is now configured to discover C# tests using dotnet-test-explorer.
- All required tasks (build, test, watch, Godot editor) are present and validated.
- Build still fails due to missing XML documentation comments, which must be resolved for test discovery to work.

### Next Steps
- Add required XML documentation comments to resolve CS1591 errors and enable test discovery.
- Confirm tests appear in VS Code Test Explorer after build errors are fixed.

### Reference
- .NET 10 RC, C# 14, Godot 4.5.1 RC2 compatibility and breaking changes reviewed via context7.
- All changes and decisions logged for future reference.
