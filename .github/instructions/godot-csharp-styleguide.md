## **Best Practices for Godot C\#**

Here’s a breakdown of the most effective patterns for writing clean, maintainable C\# code in Godot.

Always start a new session by checking the latest Godot 4.5+ documentation via Context7 to verify pretrained knowledge has not been updated.

## Godot 4.5+ C# Async/Await Initialization Pattern Verification

### Key Patterns Found in Godot 4.5 Docs:

1. **`CallDeferred` for deferred initialization**
   ```csharp
   public override void _Ready()
   {
       // Use call deferred to make sure the entire scene tree nodes are setup
       // else await on 'physics_frame' in a _ready() might get stuck.
       CallDeferred(MethodName.CustomSetup);
   }

   private async void CustomSetup()
   {
       // Async setup code here
       await ToSignal(GetTree(), SceneTree.SignalName.PhysicsFrame);
   }
   ```

2. **Signal-based synchronization** (matching Option B's `InitializationCompleted` signal):
   ```csharp
   // Await signals to synchronize operations
   await ToSignal(GetTree(), SceneTree.SignalName.ProcessFrame);
   ```

3. **Deferred execution ensures setup order**:
   - `_Ready()` is called → triggers `CallDeferred()` 
   - Base class initialization completes first
   - Only then does the deferred method execute
   - Subclass operations are guaranteed to run after base setup is complete

- **Prevents initialization ordering issues**: `MenuUi.PopulateMenuButtons()` will only run after `OmegaUi.Initialize()` fully completes
- **Officially sanctioned pattern**: This exact pattern appears in Godot 4.5 official tutorials and docs
- **Async/await ready**: The `.NET 10 RC2` + `Godot 4.6-dev-2` stack you're using has full async support
- **Signal-based coordination**: Using a custom `InitializationCompleted` signal mirrors official patterns like `PhysicsFrame` and `ProcessFrame`


### **1\. Embrace C\# Naming Conventions**

Stick to standard C\# conventions. Godot's C\# integration fully supports this.

* **Classes, methods, properties, and signals:** PascalCase  
* **Private fields:** \_camelCase or camelCase (be consistent)  
* **Godot Scene/Node files:** Keep the Godot standard snake\_case.tscn.

This creates a clear visual distinction: MyPlayer.cs (C\# script) attaches to my\_player.tscn (Godot scene).

### **2\. Use \[Export\] for Dependencies**

This is the cleanest way to link nodes in the editor. It's fast, designer-friendly, and avoids error-prone GetNode() strings.

**Good (\[Export\]):**

public partial class Player : CharacterBody2D  
{  
    // Drag-and-drop the node in the Inspector  
    \[Export\]  
    private AnimatedSprite2D \_sprite;

    public override void \_Ready()  
    {  
        \_sprite.Play("run");  
    }  
}

**Avoid (GetNode):**

public partial class Player : CharacterBody2D  
{  
    private AnimatedSprite2D \_sprite;

    public override void \_Ready()  
    {  
        // Brittle: breaks if you rename the node  
        \_sprite \= GetNode\<AnimatedSprite2D\>("AnimatedSprite2D");  
        \_sprite.Play("run");  
    }  
}

Only use GetNode\<T\>() in \_Ready() when you are *certain* a node is an internal, guaranteed child that a designer shouldn't change (like a hitbox on a weapon).

### **3\. Use C\# Signals**

Use the \[Signal\] attribute to define your signals. This lets C\# see them with full type-safety.

public partial class Player : CharacterBody2D  
{  
    // 1\. Define the signal  
    \[Signal\]  
    public delegate void HealthChangedEventHandler(int newHealth);

    private int \_health \= 100;

    public void TakeDamage(int amount)  
    {  
        \_health \-= amount;  
          
        // 2\. Emit the signal  
        EmitSignal(SignalName.HealthChanged, \_health);  
    }  
}

// In another script (e.g., your HUD)  
public partial class Hud : Control  
{  
    public void OnPlayerReady(Player player)  
    {  
        // 3\. Connect to the signal  
        player.HealthChanged \+= OnPlayerHealthChanged;  
    }

    private void OnPlayerHealthChanged(int newHealth)  
    {  
        // Update the health bar  
    }  
}

### **4\. Use Autoloads for Global Systems (Not Junk)**

**Autoloads** (singletons) are perfect for systems that are truly global.

* **Good Use:** GlobalSignalBus, SceneLoader, SaveManager, AudioManager.  
* **Bad Use:** PlayerGlobals (don't use it to store player state), EnemyUtils (don't use it as a "junk drawer" for helper functions).

The **Event Bus pattern** is the *best* use for an Autoload.

### **5\. Use C\# Properties and Events**

Instead of creating GetHealth() or SetHealth() methods, use C\# properties. You can even emit signals directly from the setter.

\[Signal\]  
public delegate void HealthChangedEventHandler(int newHealth);

private int \_health;

\[Export\]  
public int Health  
{  
    get \=\> \_health;  
    set  
    {  
        \_health \= Mathf.Clamp(value, 0, 100);  
        EmitSignal(SignalName.HealthChanged, \_health);  
    }  
}

### **6\. Use Namespaces**

To keep your project organized and avoid name collisions (e.g., your Player.cs vs. a potential NetworkingPlayer.cs), wrap your code in a namespace for your game.

namespace MyGame.Player  
{  
    public partial class Player : CharacterBody2D  
    {  
        // ...  
    }  
}

### **7\. Mind the Performance Bridge**

Calls between C\# and Godot's C++ core (e.g., GetNode(), GD.Print(), or move\_and\_slide()) have a small "marshalling" cost. This is irrelevant 99% of the time. However, in a *very* tight loop inside \_Process or \_PhysicsProcess (like iterating 10,000 particles), try to keep the logic in C\# as much as possible before making a Godot API call.

For frequent string-based lookups (e.g., input actions, signal names), use **StringName** instead of string. It's much faster as it uses a pre-calculated hash.

## **Top 10 Design Rules for Clean Software**

*(In descending priority order)*

1. **SRP (Single Responsibility Principle):** A class should have only one reason to change.  
2. **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid):** Prefer the simplest solution; avoid over-engineering.  
3. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Abstract common logic; avoid copy-pasting code.  
4. **Low Coupling, High Cohesion:** Modules should be independent of each other (low coupling) and internally focused on a single task (high cohesion).  
5. **YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It):** Don't implement features until they are actually required.  
6. **Separation of Concerns (SoC):** Don't mix logic (e.g., keep UI, data, and game logic separate).  
7. **Clarity Over Cleverness:** Write code for humans to read.  
8. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):** Code should be open for extension (inheritance, interfaces) but closed for modification.  
9. **Consistency:** Use consistent naming, patterns, and structure across the project.  
10. **Refactor Relentlessly:** Leave code cleaner than you found it (The "Boy Scout Rule").
