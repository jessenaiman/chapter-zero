applyTo: '**/*.cs'

1. **MUST USE SERANA FOR PROJECT MEMORIES (onboard first)**
2. **use the `problems` tool to see the problems in the file and ide**
3. **ALWAYS CHECK THE BUILD AFTER EVERY NEW FILE AND CHANGE**
4. **USE THE CODACY MCP TOOL TO CHECK FOR ISSUES AND FIXES**
5. **MUST ENFORCE XML Documentation Comments**


### **SOLID Principles**

* **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: A class should have only one reason to change.
* **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
* **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
* **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.
* **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: Depend on abstractions, not on concretions.

### 3. **.NET Good Practices**

* **Asynchronous Programming**: Use `async` and `await` for I/O-bound operations to ensure scalability.
* **Dependency Injection (DI)**: Leverage the built-in DI container to promote loose coupling and testability.
* **LINQ**: Use Language-Integrated Query for expressive and readable data manipulation.
* **Exception Handling**: Implement a clear and consistent strategy for handling and logging errors.
* **Modern C# Features**: Utilize modern language features (e.g., records, pattern matching) to write concise and robust code.

### 4. **Security & Compliance** 🔒

* **Domain Security**: Implement authorization at the aggregate level.
* **Financial Regulations**: PCI-DSS, SOX compliance in domain rules.
* **Audit Trails**: Domain events provide a complete audit history.
* **Data Protection**: LGPD compliance in aggregate design.

### 5. **Performance & Scalability** 🚀

* **Async Operations**: Non-blocking processing with `async`/`await`.
* **Optimized Data Access**: Efficient database queries and indexing strategies.
* **Caching Strategies**: Cache data appropriately, respecting data volatility.
* **Memory Efficiency**: Properly sized aggregates and value objects.

## DDD & .NET Standards

### Domain Layer

* **Aggregates**: Root entities that maintain consistency boundaries.
* **Value Objects**: Immutable objects representing domain concepts.
* **Domain Services**: Stateless services for complex business operations involving multiple aggregates.
* **Domain Events**: Capture business-significant state changes.
* **Specifications**: Encapsulate complex business rules and queries.

### Application Layer

* **Application Services**: Orchestrate domain operations and coordinate with infrastructure.
* **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)**: Transfer data between layers and across process boundaries.
* **Input Validation**: Validate all incoming data before executing business logic.
* **Dependency Injection**: Use constructor injection to acquire dependencies.

### Infrastructure Layer

* **Repositories**: Aggregate persistence and retrieval using interfaces defined in the domain layer.
* **Event Bus**: Publish and subscribe to domain events.
* **Data Mappers / ORMs**: Map domain objects to database schemas.
* **External Service Adapters**: Integrate with external systems.

### Testing Standards

* **Test Naming Convention**: Use `MethodName_Condition_ExpectedResult()` pattern.
* **Unit Tests**: Focus on domain logic and business rules in isolation.
* **Integration Tests**: Test aggregate boundaries, persistence, and service integrations.
* **Acceptance Tests**: Validate complete user scenarios.
* **Test Coverage**: Minimum 75% for domain and application layers.

### Development Practices

* **Event-First Design**: Model business processes as sequences of events.
* **Input Validation**: Validate DTOs and parameters in the application layer.
* **Domain Modeling**: Regular refinement through domain expert collaboration.
* **Continuous Integration**: Automated testing of all layers.

## Testing Guidelines

### Test Structure

```csharp
[Fact(DisplayName = "Descriptive test scenario")]
public void MethodNameConditionExpectedResult()
{
    // Setup for the test
    var aggregate = CreateTestAggregate();
    var parameters = new TestParameters();

    // Execution of the method under test
    var result = aggregate.PerformAction(parameters);

    // Verification of the outcome
    Assert.NotNull(result);
    Assert.Equal(expectedValue, result.Value);
}
```

### Domain Test Categories

* **Aggregate Tests**: Business rule validation and state changes.
* **Value Object Tests**: Immutability and equality.
* **Domain Service Tests**: Complex business operations.
* **Event Tests**: Event publishing and handling.
* **Application Service Tests**: Orchestration and input validation.

### Test Validation Process (MANDATORY)

**Before writing any test, you MUST:**

1.  **Verify naming follows pattern**: `MethodNameConditionExpectedResult()`
2.  **Confirm test category**: Which type of test (Unit/Integration/Acceptance).
3.  **Check domain alignment**: Test validates actual business rules.
4.  **Review edge cases**: Includes error scenarios and boundary conditions.

## Quality Checklist

**MANDATORY VERIFICATION PROCESS**: Before delivering any code, you MUST explicitly confirm each item:

### Domain Design Validation

* **Domain Model**: "I have verified that aggregates properly model business concepts."
* **Ubiquitous Language**: "I have confirmed consistent terminology throughout the codebase."
* **SOLID Principles Adherence**: "I have verified the design follows SOLID principles."
* **Business Rules**: "I have validated that domain logic is encapsulated in aggregates."
* **Event Handling**: "I have confirmed domain events are properly published and handled."

### Implementation Quality Validation

* **Test Coverage**: "I have written comprehensive tests following `MethodNameConditionExpectedResult()` naming."
* **Performance**: "I have considered performance implications and ensured efficient processing."
* **Security**: "I have implemented authorization at aggregate boundaries."
* **Documentation**: "I have documented domain decisions and architectural choices."
* **.NET Best Practices**: "I have followed .NET best practices for async, DI, and error handling."

### Financial Domain Validation

* **Monetary Precision**: "I have used `decimal` types and proper rounding for financial calculations."
* **Transaction Integrity**: "I have ensured proper transaction boundaries and consistency."
* **Audit Trail**: "I have implemented complete audit capabilities through domain events."
* **Compliance**: "I have addressed PCI-DSS, SOX, and LGPD requirements."

**If ANY item cannot be confirmed with certainty, you MUST explain why and request guidance.**

### Monetary Values

* Use `decimal` type for all monetary calculations.
* Implement currency-aware value objects.
* Handle rounding according to financial standards.
* Maintain precision throughout calculation chains.

### Transaction Processing

* Implement proper saga patterns for distributed transactions.
* Use domain events for eventual consistency.
* Maintain strong consistency within aggregate boundaries.
* Implement compensation patterns for rollback scenarios.

### Audit and Compliance

* Capture all financial operations as domain events.
* Implement immutable audit trails.
* Design aggregates to support regulatory reporting.
* Maintain data lineage for compliance audits.

### Financial Calculations

* Encapsulate calculation logic in domain services.
* Implement proper validation for financial rules.
* Use specifications for complex business criteria.
* Maintain calculation history for audit purposes.

### Platform Integration

* Use context7 to update your knowledge on DDD and .NET best practices.
* Use system standard DDD libraries and frameworks.
* Implement proper bounded context integration.
* Maintain backward compatibility in public contracts.
* Use domain events for cross-context communication.

**Remember**: These guidelines apply to ALL projects and should be the foundation for designing robust, maintainable financial systems.

## CRITICAL REMINDERS

**YOU MUST ALWAYS:**

* Show your thinking process before implementing.
* Use the mandatory verification statements.
* Follow the `MethodNameConditionExpectedResult()` test naming pattern.
* Confirm financial domain considerations are addressed.
* Stop and ask for clarification if any guideline is unclear.

**FAILURE TO FOLLOW THIS PROCESS IS UNACCEPTABLE** - The user expects rigorous adherence to these guidelines and code standards.
