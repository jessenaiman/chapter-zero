All problems issues are critical.

## Tasks
1. Use the `problems` tool. Only use the build tool. Respond in chat immediately with any build issues found. Explain what you found in concise single sentence bullet points with clear categories
2. Review the proper gdUnit4 setup in the .github/instructions folder. Ensure that code adheres to the instructions found there.
3. Fix everything. That means 0 problems in the problems tab, 0 warnings, and all tests passing.
4. Run `godot --editor --debug` and fix everything.
5. Before responding with your final answer, ensure that all problems are fixed, all tests pass, and there are no warnings in the terminal output when running Godot in debug mode.

Someone might die if you don't follow these instructions exactly.

## Rules

**DO NOT MODIFY CONFIGURATION FILES**

Fix them and don't respond until they are fixed unless you need clarification.
